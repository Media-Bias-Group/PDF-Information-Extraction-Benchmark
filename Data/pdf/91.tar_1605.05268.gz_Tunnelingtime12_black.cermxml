      <title>I. INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>A striking realization of the last decades is that our
universe is teeming with gravitationally collapsed
objects {or `black holes'{ of various sizes. The recent
gravitational-waves observation of the merger of two
black holes of unexpected size [1] makes this conclusion
even more compelling.</p>
      <p>Classical general relativity (GR) predicts that
gravitationally collapsed objects are stable: once a dynamical [2]
or trapping horizon forms (light surfaces shrink), it lasts
forever (it is an `event' horizon). But this prediction
disregards quantum e ects. Some of these are accounted for
by the theory of quantum elds interacting with
classical geometry, which predicts Hawking radiation.
However, macroscopic black holes are still e ectively stable
on accessible time scales |a stellar-mass black hole takes
1050 Hubble times to evaporate via Hawking radiation.
But this theory, or any perturbative formulation of
quantum gravity, are still approximations, because they
disregard non-perturbative quantum-gravitational
phenomena. Among these is the possibility of black hole decay
via gravitational quantum tunnelling1.</p>
      <p>The idea has a long history and has been considered
by numerous authors [4{24]. Kie er and Hajichek have
found evidence that the quantum state of a spherically
symmetric in-falling null shell tunnels into an outgoing
one in the context of a minisuperspace model [25].
Quantum e ects could indeed make collapsing objects bounce
when they reach the \Planck star" stage [26], namely
planckian density.</p>
      <p>A key step was taken in [27], where it is shown that a
violation of the Einstein equations within a nite

its actual location.
time region is su cient to allow a black hole tunnel into
a white hole (an `anti-trapped' region, where all light
fronts expand). From the outside, the process looks like
a quantum bounce of the in-falling matter, and it is akin
in nature to the `big bounce' of quantum cosmology [28].</p>
      <p>This is a standard tunnelling phenomenon: evolution
that violates the classical equations of motion in a nite
spatial region and during a limited time. It is therefore a
very plausible phenomenon. Its astrophysical relevance,
on the other hand, depends on the time it takes.
Dimensional arguments suggest that accumulation of small
quantum e ects could trigger the tunnelling already after
a time m2 in Planck units, where m is the mass of the
collapsed object [27]. This is su ciently long to be
compatible with the black holes we observe in the sky, but
much shorter than the huge Hawking evaporation time
H m3. Hawking radiation could be a sub-dominant
phenomenon, with respect to the bounce. Writing ~
explicitly gives m2=p~, which indicates that this is not
a perturbative phenomenon.</p>
      <p>A lifetime m2 implies that primordial black holes
of lunar-size mass could be exploding today and yield
observable signals [29]. A component of the expected
resulting signal is tantalisingly similar to the recently observed
Fast Radio Bursts [30]. Fast Radio Bursts [31{34] could
thus be the rst genuinely quantum gravitational
phenomenon ever observed [35, 36]. A second, high energy,
component of the signal could be the source of some very
high-energy cosmic rays. In both cases the expected
signal has a signature distance-frequency relation that
characterises it [37, 38]. Maybe black holes could `reveal their
inner secrets' [39] after all, thanks to quantum theory.</p>
      <p>The rst objective of this paper is to compute the
black-hole lifetime from a full quantum theory of gravity,
to assess the credibility of the dimensional estimate of
[27] and therefore ground the astrophysical relevance of
black hole tunnelling.</p>
      <p>Since the quantum bounce of a Planck star is a
nonperturbative phenomenon, it is not captured by the small
quantum uctuations around a classical solution of the
Einstein equations. Therefore it can only be described
by a background-free quantum theory of gravity. Here
we use Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) which provides a
non-perturbative de nition of quantum gravity [40{43] .</p>
      <p>LQG is tailor-made for this calculation, because in its
covariant formulation [44{50] it associates an amplitude
to any compact region of spacetime, as a function of the
boundary geometry. In a Planck star bounce, we know
the initial and nal geometry, we know that no
classical solution interpolates between the two, and we need
the probability for a quantum transition from the rst
to the second. This is precisely what the amplitudes of
covariant LQG provide.</p>
      <p>The calculation we present is thus a concrete
example of how a background-free quantum theory of gravity
can be used to predict observable quantities. The
difculty of computing realistically measurable quantities
in a background-free quantum theory is well known [51{
54]: it raises conceptual subtleties related to the notion
of time, to the di culty of de ning general covariant
observables and to locality. The second objective of this
paper is to show concretely how such a calculation can
be done, and how all these problems can be successfully
addressed. We consider this a major result of this paper.</p>
      <p>The article is organised as follows. In Section we
explain how a gravitational tunnelling amplitude can be
computed and we list the assumptions and
approximations we take. In Section we discuss the intuitive
physical picture of the phenomenon we analyse. In Section we
write the external metric. In Section we x the
boundary between the region that we consider classical and the
region we treat as the quantum system, and we compute
its geometry. In Section we specify the triangulation we
use for the quantum calculation. In Section we write the
quantum state of the boundary. In Section we compute
the amplitude. In Section we begin to analyze it.</p>
      <p>Appendix recalls the basic equations of loop
quantum gravity. Appendix summarizes our result giving
the amplitude in a self-contained form useful for future
developments.</p>

      <title>II. QUANTUM TUNNELLING</title>
      <p>We study the black hole tunnelling process and we
derive explicitly the amplitude W (m; T ) for a collapsed
object of mass m to tunnel out after a time T , under a
number of simplifying assumptions and approximations.
These are listed below.</p>
      <p>1. We assume vanishing angular momentum of the
collapsing object. This is not a plausible
assumption for astrophysical objects, but it is the best we
can do so far.
2. We take as collapsing object a spherical, thin, null
shell, with mass (energy) m. This too is a drastic
simpli cation, because it eliminates the complexity
of the accretion and the physics of the explosion;
essentially, we disregard most of the dynamics of
matter.
3. We disregard dissipative phenomena, such as
Hawking radiation. This is a good approximation to the
extent that the bounce time turns out to be faster
than the Hawking evaporation time. Accordingly,
we disregard the thermal properties of quantum
black holes [55{57] and we do not consider the
constraints on the mass loss rate studied in [58] nor
the corresponding back reaction.
4. We assume the process to be time-reversal
invariant. This is related to the previous point, because
Hawking radiation breaks time reversal symmetry.
In particular, we disregard the possibility of
instabilities (see for instance [23, 59]). A time
asymmetric version of a black hole bounce which addresses
these issues is studied in [60].
5. We work at rst order in the vertex expansion [50].</p>
      <p>This means that we assume the phenomenon to be
dominated by large scale degrees of freedom. This
is needed in order to extract a doable computation
from the full non-perturbative de nition of the
theory.</p>
      <p>Under these assumptions, we derive the bounce
amplitude W (m; T ) and we write it explicitly at the end of this
paper. In turn, this quantity determines the black hole
lifetime (m).</p>
      <p>The explicit expression for W (m; T ) that we derive is
nite (no divergences) and self contained. However, it
is given by a complicated sums of integrals and is not
transparent. It is also too complicated for a
straightforward numerical evaluation. Its evaluation require
further work, which is course and will be reported
elsewhere. Here we only mention, in closure, the preliminary
tentative indications that we have been able to derive so
far from it. These seem to be support the quadratic
dependence of the evaporation on the mass: m2.
The main goal of the present paper is only to derive the
expression for W (m; T ), and discuss the technical and
conceptual questions raised by the calculation.</p>
      <p>Gravitational tunnelling has been treated in the
literature mostly in the context of tunnelling of the
entire universe, using WKB techniques and Euclidean
solutions (see for instance [61, 62] and references therein).
This is not what we do here. The phenomenon we study
concerns a small nite spacetime region, and we study
it using the Lorentzian geometry-to-geometry transition
amplitude.</p>
      <p>To compute this amplitude, we choose a hypersurface
surrounding the region where quantum e ects cannot
be neglected. includes also a small region outside the
horizon, because the process we consider needs quantum
e ects to leak outside the horizon, a possibility that has
recently drawn increasing attention [63, 64]. Under the
assumptions listed above, the external geometry is given
in [27] and depends only on two parameters: the mass m
of the collapsing object and the decay time T . In
particular, the external geometry determines the (intrinsic and
extrinsic) geometry of . We represent this geometry by
means of a quantum state, and compute the associated
transition amplitude. has a past and a future
component (the past and the future boundaries of the quantum
region), and W (m; T ) can be seen as the transition
amplitude between the past and the future state. Intuitively, it
can be thought of as the path integral over geometries in
the quantum region where the collapsed object bounces
(tunnels).</p>
      <p>This strategy solves the problem of time in the
following sense. The calculation does not require a speci c
time variable to describe evolution, while a physically
(partial [52, 65]) observable clock time T is identi ed as
one of the parameters of the boundary state (see [43] for a
full discussion). The bounce region itself does not admit
a classical spacetime picture at all, in the same sense in
which there is no single trajectory for a quantum electron
during a quantum leap between two atomic orbitals. In
the bounce region, the `architecture' [66] of the quantum
geometry is fully non classical.</p>
      <p>The modulus squared of the amplitude W (m; T )
determines the probability density for the process to happen
at a given (external) time T , for a given mass m. The
lifetime of the black hole is given by requiring the total
probability that the hole has not decayed before to be
of order unit. For consistency with traditional de nitions
of lifetime (for instance in nuclear physics)) we set this
to e 1; that is, we de ne the lifetime by</p>
      <p>
        Z
0
Since we work to rst order in the vertex expansion (point
5. of the previous section), the estimate of the full T
integral is unreliable. Pending a higher order calculation,
we circumvent the problem by taking the (reasonable)
assumption that the probability density for an existing
black hole to decay within a small interval of time is
constant |as it is the case in standard radioactive decay|
which is to say the probability for the black hole to have
decayed after a time T from its formation takes the
exponential decay form
p(T ) = 1
e T = ;
(
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
        )
possibly after a short initial transient. This will allow
us to compute the black hole lifetime simply from the
value of the function W (m; T ) on two points (one for the
normalisation and one for ), as we show below in Section
.
      </p>
      <p>The interpretation of the amplitude we compute
requires an important discussion, essential to understand
the present setting. In standard radioactive decay, a
particle tunnels out from the potential barrier that traps it
inside the nucleus. If we evolve an initial quantum state
of the particle using the Schrodinger equation, we nd
a state that slowly leaks out of the con ning potential.
After some time, the quantum state describes a quantum
superposition of many di erent positions of the particle,
corresponding to di erent escape times from the nucleus.
A Geiger counter will detect the escaping particle at some
time and in a single position, corresponding to a speci c
decay time T . Formally, the measurement projects the
widely spread quantum state to a localized
semiclassical state of the particle, and realizes a single time for
the decay, which is determined probabilistically by the
initial state. Equivalently (depending on one's preferred
way of thinking about quantum theory): the branches of
the state corresponding to di erent decay times decohere
rapidly, due to the interaction with the outside world.</p>
      <p>We use this same logic for the case of the black hole.
The quantum state of the geometry in the future of a
collapsed object is formed by a quantum state spread over
vastly di erent geometries, as discussed in [67]. Due to
the large number of degrees of freedom involved, these
decohere rapidly. Equivalently: any interaction of the
geometry in the future of the quantum region \projects"
the widely spread quantum state onto a given classical
geometry, realising (probabilistically) a well determined
black hole explosion time T . We are interested in the
probability distribution of this explosion time. Quantum
mechanics allows us to compute this probability by
sandwiching the transition amplitude between an initial and a
nal state. This is what we do here. We isolate the region
where quantum phenomena cannot be disregarded and
describe the quantum phenomenon in terms of the
probability for di erent possible classical evolutions of the
world (outside and) after the transition region, namely
for di erent values of T .
star" [26]. Importantly, this happens when the object
has still a size many orders of magnitude larger than the
Planck length [26, 68]. At this scale, the curvature
becomes Planckian as well (that is: scalar functions of the
curvature such as RabcdRabcd reach the Planck scale).
Simple dimensional arguments indicate that quantum
mechanical e ects become dominant. The classical
Einstein equations are thus necessarily violated by quantum
e ects at this scale. This is consistent with the standard
picture in Loop Quantum Cosmology.</p>
      <p>Quantum e ects can act as an e ective pressure, as
in Loop Quantum Cosmology. These are akin to the
quantum pressure that forbids an electron to fall into
an atomic nucleus. Gravitational collapse can therefore
stop and the Planck star can \bounce out" via quantum
tunnelling into a new classical solution of the Einstein
equations.</p>
      <p>This naive picture, however, is incomplete, because it
assumes a classical geometry, disregarding in particular
the fact that quantum-gravitational e ects are not
necessarily con ned to a xed-geometry causal future of the
matter bounce. Quantum uctuations of the background
causal structure can allow violations of the
backgroundgeometry causality. This is the mechanism that permits
quantum e ects to leak outside the horizon.</p>
      <p>Indeed, notice that in the standard geometry of a
collapse a generic spacetime point outside the horizon is
only a single Planck space-like distance away from the
singularity. This is counter-intuitive at rst, but true,
due to the Lorentzian nature of spacetime (see Figure 2).
Therefore there is no surprise, nor violation of any known
fundamental physical low that we know, if quantum
effects leak outside the horizon. This cannot happen in
quantum eld theory over a xed background, but there
is no reason we know it should not happen when the
full quantum dynamics of the gravitational eld is taken
into account, including the non-perturbative e ects that
are not accounted for by quantum eld theory on curved
spacetime. Here we see clearly the limitation of local
quantum eld theory. See [69], and in particular the
contributions by Giddings and Rovelli therein, for a recent
discussion of this essential point.</p>
      <p>The violation of Einstein's equations outside the
horizon opens the channel for the matter bounce, the
tunnelling of the black hole into a white hole, and the
explosion.</p>
      <p>The most appealing aspects of this picture is its
temporal structure. At rst, there seems to be a tension
between the long time during which a black hole is in
existence, namely the long black hole lifetime (after all,
a black hole is macroscopic object, we cannot expect a
short tunnelling time) on the one hand, and the short
time required by the bounce picture on the other hand.
But the tension is beautifully resolved by the general
relativistic time dilatation: the bouncing process can be at
the same time extremely fast measured by a clock on the
star, and extremely long in external time, due to the huge
gravitational redshift between the inside and the outside
of the hole. This is concretely realized in the metric
computed in [27].</p>
      <p>The black holes we see in the sky could be \bouncing
stars", seen at the extreme slow motion implied by the
standard general relativistic time dilation [26].</p>
      <p>The fact that this intriguing physical picture has a
chance to be supported by direct astrophysical
observations [29{34, 37, 38] renders it, in our opinion, well worth
studying.</p>
      <p>We now close the introductory discussion and get to
the actual calculation of the the black hole lifetime. We
emphasize the fact that very little of this intuitive picture
of the phenomenon is relevant for the calculation below,
which simply moves from rst principles to compute a
quantum transition amplitude between an incoming and
an outgoing classical state.</p>

      <title>IV. EXTERNAL CLASSICAL METRIC</title>
      <p>We are interested in the geometry describing the
collapse and the bounce of a null shell found in [27] and
illustrated by the (Carter-Penrose) causal diagram of Figure
1. The relevant aspect of this geometry is that it is an
exact solution of Einstein's equations outside a compact
region. In the gure, the thick grey lines represent the
incoming and outgoing spherical shell. The dotted lines
represent the black hole (trapping) horizon and the white
hole (anti-trapping) horizon. The metric is at in the
white region and Schwarzschild in the light grey region.
More precisely, the light grey region is a portion of a
double covering of the Kruskal extension of the Schwarzschild
metric, as illustrated in Figure 3. This is why the white
hole can be in the future of the black hole, as explained
in detail in [27]. The dark grey area of Figure 1 is the
quantum region {namely the region where the classical
equations are violated{ which concerns us in this paper.
We call rS and tS the standard Schwarzschild coordinates
that cover the region of the Kruskal diagram outside the
horizons. The spacetime is time reversal invariant and
we assign the Schwarzschild time tS = 0 to the re ection
hypersurface.</p>
      <p>There are two important points (spheres in spacetime)
in these diagrams, which we denote and .</p>
      <p>The point is the point where the incoming shell
crosses the surface with Schwarzschild time tS = 0 in
the Kruskal diagram. With a slight abuse of notation,
we call also the dimensionless fractional Schwarzschild
radial distance from the horizon, that is we write
=
rS( )

      <p>;
rS( ) = 2m(1 + );
(rS(P ) is the Schwarzschild radial coordinate of the point
P ), or equivalently
Notice that is the image of two spacetime points
(spheres), one on the collapsing shell and one on the
exploding shell, both just outside the horizons, indicated
respectively as and 0 in the r.h.s. panel of Figure 3.</p>
      <p>In [27] it is shown that (for 1) the bouncing time
observed by an external observer (de ned as the proper
time of a distant observer sitting at radius R 2m from
the moment she sees the in-falling shell passing by, to the
moment she sees the out-going shell passing by, minus
the time 2R for the shell to go in and come out from the
rS 2m region) is</p>
      <p>T =
The meaning of the time T is clari ed by Figure 4, which
displays the process in Schwarzschild coordinates. These
cover only the region outside the horizons.</p>
      <p>The point is the point where the map between
spacetime and the Kruskal geometry bifurcates, which we take
a bit outside the quantum region. Again with abuse of
notation, we write the Schwarzschild radius of the point
in the form
rS( ) = 2m(1 +</p>
      <p>
        ):
&lt;
because the two points where the ingoing and outgoing
shells cross tS = 0 must be distinct in physical space, and
therefore inside the bifurcation point (see Figure 3.)

in Schwarzschild coordinates: the shell (thick line) freezes
near the horizon (dashed line) until it reaches the point ,
hence bounces back. The bounce time T is the Schwarzschild
time during which the shell hovers near the horizon. An
observer at Schwarzschild radius R sees the shell emerge after a
time which is T plus the time for the shell to go in and come
out. The grey region is where quantum e ects leak outside
the horizon and the Einstein equations are violated.

      <title>THE BOUNDARY AND ITS GEOMETRY</title>
      <p>We now choose a surface surrounding the quantum
region. This will be the boundary for the computation
of the transition amplitude. As discussed in the
introduction, quantum probabilities are computed, a la Bohr,
at the boundary with the classical world. As stressed by
Wigner [70], there is arbitrariness in choosing the
boundary between a quantum system and the classical world,
in computing quantum probabilities; accordingly, there
is a freedom in choosing . We want to be su ciently
away from the tunneling region to be sure to capture
all quantum e ects. That is, su ciently away from the
tunneling region to permit the external region to be well
approximated by classical physics. But it is convenient
to choose of minimal size, in order to minimise the
technical complexity of the calculation.</p>
      <p>Tentatively, we choose the surface depicted in Figure
5. To de ne it, it is convenient to use di erent
coordinates than the Schwarzschild coordinates. Very
convenient coordinates are the Lema^tre coordinates [71, 72]
which are in time gauge (Lapse=1, Shift=0), the gauge
in which LQG transition amplitudes are written. In these
coordinates, which we denote r and t, the Schwarzschild
geometry reads

        Each t = constant hypersurface crosses the tS = 0
hypersurface at a point (sphere) of Schwarzschild radius
rS(t) (see Fig. 6), which is obtained by setting tS = 0 in
(
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>
        ). In particular, consider the t = constant
hypersurface that crosses the tS = 0 in . The portion B of this
hypersurface inside is a 3d (topological) ball bounded
by the two-sphere . Its image under time reversal B+
is a 3d (topological) ball with the same boundary. We
choose as the union of B and B+.
      </p>
      <p>To be sure, the actual surface , which is depicted in
Figure 5 and 8, is not entirely within the Schwarzschild
region, because both its past and its future branches are
cut by the ingoing and, respectively, outgoing, shells,
inside which the metric is at. We disregard this fact here,
under the assumption that the geometry of this small
region has no e ect on the transition, and we take the
geometry to be exactly the union of B and B+.</p>
      <p>
        It is easy to obtain the value of t on B : assuming
0 &lt; 1, posing tS = 0 (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>

seen as follows. The variation of (

the time reversal symmetry, the geometry of B+ is the
time reversal of the geometry of B . This means that the
intrinsic geometry is the same, while the extrinsic
curvature is the same but with opposite sign. A ip of sign in
the conjugate momentum is of course the hallmark of a
bounce (a ball that bounces on the oor ips its velocity
almost suddenly). Thus, the tunnelling process we are
considering is the ip of sign of the extrinsic curvature of
B : something like snapping over a cap (Figure 7).

quantum gravity, however, is based on the tetrad-spin

a spin network state describing the boundary geometry,

a single spin network graph, dual to a simple
triangulation of the continuum boundary geometry, and represent
the geometry of via a coherent state peaked on
discrete data approximating the boundary geometry; and
(ii), the lowest order spin foam amplitude. Before going

      <title>VI. DISCRETIZATION</title>
      <p>The boundary surface is formed by two ( at) balls
joined at their (spherical) boundary. A ball can be nicely
triangulated by a single equilateral at tetrahedron o.
We re ne this triangulation splitting o into 4 equal
isosceles tetrahedra, as in Fig.10. The boundary surface
is then triangulated by eight tetrahedra (four in B
and four in B+) connected to one another as in Figure
9, where the tetrahedra are the nodes of the graph. This
is not the minimal triangulation of , but {as we shall
see{ is the boundary of the minimal triangulation of
the region enclosed by , which respects time reversal
invariance.</p>
      <p>
        We now derive the data describing the geometry of
this triangulation. We do so in two steps. First, in terms
of the metric formalism, giving the area of all the
triangles of the triangulation and {again at each triangle{
the 4d boost angles between tetrahedra normals, which
discretise the extrinsic curvature. Next, we give the
discrete version of the Ashtekar variables, called the ux and
holonomy variables. All these data can be immediately

forming the two sphere . Because of the symmetries
of , and because each 3-ball is at, we will see that we
can take all isosceles tetrahedra with the same shape, so
that all links `ab (straight links of the graph) are dual
to triangles that have the same area A = A+ and
extrinsic curvature angle . The four links `a (curved in
the picture) are dual to triangles that have area Ao and
extrinsic curvature angle o. These are \thin" triangles,

        As for the discrete extrinsic curvature, this is

between the 4d normals to the tetrahedra. On the sphere
this is given by o. More precisely the triangles
discretising , such as ABC, are thin and o, given in (

is the angle between their future normals.
2 Using the notation of the gure, by elementary geometry the
height of a face is ED = EC = 3 EF and the height of the
tetrahedron o is CF = 4 OF . By Pythagoras theorem on the
two triangles EF O and EF C a line of algebra gives immediately
that EC = p6 EO.

      <p>The discrete curvature on the radial triangles, such as
ABO, is determined by the tangential part of kab, which
depends on the time dependence of the tangential
components of the metric. We can determine it as follows.
Let dV be the change of volume of a tetrahedron in a
time dt, due to a change in the metric. This change can
be split into two parts: a change of volume dVrad due to
the change in qrr which corresponds to a growth normal
to the basis of , and a change dVtang due to the angular

      <p>
        Next we compute the discretized version of the Ashtekar
variables describing the geometry of the triangulation.
These are the variables in terms of which the coherent
states of loop quantum gravity are de ned. They are
the holonomy- ux variables (X~ ; H) respectively in R3
and SU (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
        ), associated to each triangle. Like the triad
and Ashtekar variables, these introduce a local rotation
gauge. Geometrically, this corresponds to xing a local
frame on each tetrahedron; see [73] for a discussion.
      </p>
      <p>The holonomy- ux variables allow a generalisation of
the Regge geometry, called twisted geometry [74], where
the discontinuity of the metric on the triangles allow a
mismatch of the shape of the shared triangles [75]; here
we are not concerned with this generalisation, since we
use these variables to describe the Regge geometry
constructed above.</p>
      <p>The \ ux" Xi = R Eiana is the ux of the densitized
tried Ea, a two-form, across each triangle. Here na is the
i
geometrical normal to the triangle. Choosing a constant
Euclidean triad Eia(x) = ia with each tetrahedron, X~ =
fXig is simply given by X~ = A~n, the unit normal ~n to
the face, in the coordinates de ned by the triad chosen in
the tetrahedron, multiplied by the area A of the triangle.
More precisely, since the triad on the triangulation is
in general discontinuous across the (oriented) triangle,
there are two vectors, ~n and ~n0 associated to its source
and target sides respectively.</p>
      <p>
        The \holonomy" H 2 SU (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
        ) is the holonomy of the
Ashtekar connection A, along a line (\link") dual to the
triangle. Since the triad chosen is constant inside each
tetrahedron, both the extrinsic curvature and the spin
connection on a triangulation are distributional and
concentrated on the triangle, therefore the holonomy is a
single group element associated to the triangle itself and
the exact points where the link starts and ends in the
tetrahedra are irrelevant. The holonomy is the group
element that turns the two triads on the two tetrahedra
into one another. It depends on the two ingredients of
A, the spin connection (E) and the extrinsic curvature
multiplied by the Immirzi parameter K. The holonomy
of the spin connection alone is
where n and n0 are SU (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
        ) group elements that turn the
unit vector in the z direction z^ into ~n and ~n0
respectively (the minus sign is because we take all normal
vectors to tetrahedra faces as outgoing), and is the
rotation angle in the (x; y) plane needed to match the x; y
axis of the two triads across the face.3 However, the
exponentiation of the K term also contributes a rotation
3 To x for general twisted geometries one has to pick a preferred
edge, see [76, 77]; the angle can be nicely parametrised in terms
of spinors' phases in the spinor formalism [73, 77, 78].

non-vanishing component of the extrinsic curvature of a
triangulation is kab nanb. Therefore the discretized
holonomy reads
where is boost angle between the normals of the
tetrahedra. Thus, in the discretization of the Ashtekar
variables the extrinsic curvature is coded into an extra
rotation along the normal to triangles [75, 79]. The relation
is the discrete equivalent of the Ashtekar-Barbero
relation A = (E) + K.4 Notice that the quantity is
gauge invariant.
      </p>
      <p>
        The map from ~n to n is not unique, because there are
many rotations n that brings z^ into ~n, that is, di

Di erent choices of map di er by a rotation along the

rotation is around an axis normal to both z^ and ~n. This
is the one used in the de nition of the SU (

        ) coherent
states. Explicitly, describing a unit vector with its polar
angles ~n = ( ; ), it is given by
For the target of the same link, we compensate the minus
sign by adding a parity transformation (given by P =

      </p>
      <p>
        Since the tetrahedra are all equal, we can exploit the
local rotational freedom to assign the same four normals
to all of them. Using the orientation of Figure 11, we get

that is to align the edges, a further rotation around the

      <p>The modulus square jW (m; T )j2 is proportional to the
probability density for the process to happen at time T .
Assuming that the process happens, the proportionality
constant is determined by requiring the total
probability to be unit. This gives in particular the probability

        The integration for all T is problematic: (46) is
periodic in the boost parameters o and , with period 4 = ,
and o becomes larger than 4 = for large T , see (47).
As discussed in [87], the periodicity makes the amplitude
ill de ned, and its validity should be restricted to a single
period. To allow for large T then, one needs to go to a
higher order in the vertex expansion. Therefore the use
of the simple discretisation de ned above, and the
quantum amplitude associated to it derived above, should be
used for small T . A meaningful half-life can still be
extracted at this level of approximation, if, as mentioned
in the Introduction, we consider an additional
hypothesis on the decay of the black hole: that, at least in some

dominates and we can write</p>

As we will see, this decouples the z data, and thus the
m and T dependence, from the combinatorial structure
of SU (

          ) and SL(2; C).

where the four-valent intertwiners are given as a
product of two Wigner 3j symbols, see Appendix . Using this,
we can perform all the SU (
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
          ) integrals, giving
intertwiners that join the indices of the matrices Dj (n). To each
node correspond four intertwiners, two from the u
integration and two from the v integration, one for each of
the four (half-) links attached to the node.
        </p>
        <p>Bringing all of the above together, W (m; T ) can be
written as a sum over the spin con gurations fja; jabg,
with the summand containing an eight-dimensional real
integral over dra and contractions between these
integrals, 3j symbols and Wigner's matrices.</p>
        <p>Because of the highest-weight approximation, the
dependence on the spacetime parameters m and T (z data)
is pulled into a weight function w(z0; z ; ja; jab). Then,
in order to arrive to a compact expression, we rearrange
the combinatorial structure and the gauge data (normals)
at the level of nodes. The orientations of the spinfoam
and its boundary as de ned in Figs. 9, 12, 13, were
chosen so that the pattern of signs appearing in the indices
of the various objects and the functional dependence of
the boost integrands are identical for each node.</p>
        <p>
          Before giving the nal expression, we remind and
explain notation: spins on the four angular links are
labelled as ja and on the twelve radial links as jab, where
ab ba and a 6= b. Spins appearing in (
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">65</xref>
          ) are
indicated as capital letters and labelled as Ja , they live on
the eight four-valent nodes. The composite index fja g is
the set of indices on the links connected to the node a
(one ja and three jab). Magnetic indices of Wigner's

trices live on half-links and are indicated as fma g, where
a right arrow means those ingoing to the node come with
a minus sign while a left arrow that those outgoing to the
node come with a minus sign.</p>
        <p>
          Explicitly, with a bit of algebra, we have

In this expression we see explicitly that the \position" variable j is peaked on the area Re(z)2 and the conjugate

        <p>Preliminary partially numerical and partially
analytical estimates developed in [89] appears to support the
lifetime m2. The mechanism for this to happen is
intriguing: taking the semiclassical approximation where
the horizon area is xed to its classical value, namely
restricting the sum to a xed value of the spins associated
to the surfaces representing the size of the black hole
horizon (ja jmax m2), renders the lifetime in nite. But
including uctuations of the horizon area (terms in the
sum ja 6= jmax) generates interference terms that makes
the lifetime nite. This suggests that the tunneling
channel could be open precisely by the quantum uctuations
of the geometry at the horizon.</p>

        States are de ned over four-valent graphs. The nodes
n of the graph represent quanta of space. The links ` the
graph represent the surfaces between the quanta of space.
A state is represented by a square integrable function
(h`), where h` 2 SU (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
        ), for every link `. The
interpretation of h` is the holonomy of the Ashtekar connection
between two nodes.
      </p>
      <p>Coherent states approximating a discrete classical
intrinsic and intrinsic geometry have been constructed by
various authors. Here we shall use the states de ned in
[85] that depend on a complex number z = + i and
two unit-length 3d vectors ~n; ~n0 per each link `. These

matrices analytically extended to complex parameters and
we have indicated with n and n0 the SU (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
        ) elements
corresponding to the rotation of the z axis to the vectors ~n
and ~n0. These states can be seen as a smearing of the
states
z;~n;~n0 (h) = (h; n0ez 23 n 1)
(A2)
which are peaked on the holonomy h = n0ez 23 n 1. They
have the property that the expectation value of the
geometrical operators de nes a discrete geometry where ~n
and ~n0 are the normals to the face dual to the link, in the
frames of the two quanta, is the (dimensionless) area of
the face, and is, in the gauge where ~n = ~n0, the angle
between the 4d normals to the two space quanta, namely
the boost giving the relative velocity between the two.
