        <p>Cerium hexaboride is a cubic f -electron heavy-fermion compound that displays a rich array of low-temperature magnetic ordering phenomena which have been the subject of investigation for more than 50 years. Its complex behaviour is the result of competing interactions, with both itinerant and local electrons playing important roles. Investigating this material has proven to be a substantial challenge, in particular because of the appearance of a “magnetically hidden order” phase, which remained elusive to neutron-scattering investigations for many years. It was not until the development of modern x-ray scattering techniques that the long suspected multipolar origin of this phase was confirmed. Doping with non-magnetic lanthanum dilutes the magnetic cerium sublattice and reduces the f -electron count, bringing about substantial changes to the ground state with the emergence of new phases and quantum critical phenomena. To this day, Ce1 x Lax B6 and its related compounds remain a subject of intense interest. Despite the substantial progress in understanding their behaviour, they continue to reveal new and unexplained physical phenomena. Here we present a review of the accumulated body of knowledge on this family of materials in order to provide a firm standpoint for future investigations.</p>

      <p>
        CeB6 has been the subject of continued examination for many years, its simple cubic structure
containing a rich plethora of low-temperature ordering phenomena. Aside from a more
conventional low-temperature antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase it is well known for displaying a
“magnetically hidden order” phase, so called because it is invisible to neutron scattering in no
applied field, and systematically investigating this system has proven to be a challenge for both
experiment and theory. Interest originates not only from the complexity of its low-temperature
phase diagram but also in its origin: a variety of intricate spin- and orbital-ordered phases in a
system with a simple, high-symmetry crystal structure indicates complex electronic correlations
arising from an interplay of several competing energy scales. Indeed, as an f -electron
heavyfermion compound it is well placed to display some of the more exotic phenomena which are of
interest to modern condensed matter physics. The goal of this review is to draw a coherent picture
from the myriad of investigations which have been done into CeB6 and its doped derivatives such
as Ce1 x Lax B6 since its original synthesis in 1932 [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">1</xref>
        ]. Following its discovery, much attention was
paid to its potential as a cathode material [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1 ref5">2</xref>
        ], with some early interest in the following decades
regarding its physical behaviour [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2 ref3 ref6 ref7 ref8 ref9">3–6</xref>
        ] before modern condensed matter physics became interested
in its magnetic ordering phenomena.
      </p>
      <p>
        Setting the scene for this review, we present the phase diagrams for Ce1 x Lax B6 in Fig. 1.
Panel (a) shows the applied magnetic field vs. temperature phase diagram for pure CeB6 [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">7</xref>
        ]. We
see that in zero field the ground state of CeB6 is antiferromagnetic (phase III). It gives way to an
antiferroquadrupolar (AFQ) phase (phase II) at TN = 2.4 K, which survives up until TQ = 3.2 K [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">8</xref>
        ],
above which the system is in the paramagnetic state (phase I). The transition temperatures in
early measurements were slightly sample dependent, with noticeable changes arising from crystal
growth technique and annealing [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11 ref12 ref13 ref14 ref15">8–12</xref>
        ]. As a function of increasing field, B, the AFM state evolves
from phase III to phase III0, which shall be discussed later in section , and at low fields TQ(B)
possesses a positive slope indicating that this phase is stabilised in field. Panel (b) shows the
lanthanum doping – applied field phase diagram extrapolated to zero temperature [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">13</xref>
        ]. We see
that for concentrations of lanthanum higher than 0.3, we enter phase IV at low field, the nature
of which is discussed in section . This phase is stabilised against the field with increasing lanthanum
doping, competing with phase III. Panel (c) shows the lanthanum doping vs. temperature phase
diagram in zero field [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">14</xref>
        ]. Panel (d) summarizes the various phases of Ce1 x Lax B6 as a function
of temperature, applied magnetic field and doping parameter x in a 3D sketch [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">15</xref>
        ].
      </p>
      <p>Pure CeB6 expresses three distinct phases, labelled as phases I, II and III, and with lanthanum
doping a further phase IV appears. There are zero-field quantum critical points (QCP) at x 0.3,
where phase III gives way to phase IV, and at x 0.7, where phase IV disappears. In an applied
field a tri-critical point between phases II, III and IV appears, whose position in doping depends on
the crystal direction along which the magnetic field is applied. For the field applied in the h110i
direction this point sits at around 2 T and x 0.5, however for fields applied along the h100i
direction, shown in panel (b), this point is shifted to higher fields and lower cerium content. The
phase diagrams reproduced here are only a small selection of the data available in the published
literature. In table 1, we present a list of all the published phase diagrams known to us, covering

sistance of CexLa1−xB6 (x = 0.75, 0.5, 0.25) and con
cluded that the ground state of Ce0.5La0.5B6 is the
AF phase IV from the quite different H dependence

x = 0.5. In the former, the magnitude of the neg
ative magnetoresistance becomes large with decreasing
temperature as is usually observed in the dilute Kondo
a wide variety of techniques and experimental configurations. With the available parameters
of magnetic field (B), temperature (T), pressure (P) and lanthanum concentration (x), as well
as the changing behaviour of the phase diagram with magnetic field applied along the three
principal crystal directions, this represents a multidimensional parameter space which no single
investigation can cover.</p>
        <p>
          Despite the early classification of the ground state of CeB6 as an AFM state, this material
continues to reveal unexpected behaviour, such as the ferromagnetic low-energy modes revealed by
neutron scattering which dominate the low energy excitation spectrum [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">36</xref>
          ]. Such measurements
illustrate that there is still much to be discovered regarding CeB6 and related heavy-fermion
systems, both in terms of a complete set of experimentally observed behaviour and the theoretical
background with which to describe it. Here we present a review of published information, alongside
new measurements, in order to build a comprehensive picture of our current understanding of
Ce1 x Lax B6.

          <title>2. Parent Compound – CeB6</title>
          <p>2.1. Crystal and electronic structure of CeB6</p>
          <p>
            CeB6 possesses a simple-cubic structure comprised of Ce3+ ions in a cubic lattice separated by
B6 octahedra, shown in Fig. 2, characterized by the P m3¯m space group and a unit cell parameter
a = 4.14 Å. The structure can be considered as a combination of two cubic lattices, each arranged so
that it is body-centred to the other, with one lattice consisting of the B6 octahedra and the other of
cerium ions. It was noted in early research that the B6 octahedra, which form a covalently bonded
structure, require two additional electrons from the cerium ions in order to stabilise [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40 ref41">37, 38</xref>
            ]. The
outer electronic structure of cerium is [Xe]4 f 15d16s2, with the two s-electrons being donated to
the boron octahedra, and it is generally considered that the f -electron states remain localised with
the d-electrons forming the conduction band, resulting in the Ce3+ ion. However, the nature of the
f -electron states, whether they are localised or itinerant, is a topic still under debate. Whilst much
of the low-temperature ordering phenomena can be understood in the more simplistic picture of
localised f -electrons and itinerant d-electrons, it is important to keep in mind that under a more
rigorous scrutiny the behaviour of the f -electrons seems far less trivial, and discussion of this is
Ce

reserved for section . It is, however, the capacity for the f -electron states to support various types
of multipolar ordering that lead to the rich low-temperature phase diagram of CeB6.
          </p>
          <p>
            Initially, it was thought that the Ce3+ multiplet 4 f 1 is split by the crystalline electric field
into a 7 ground state with a 8 excited state [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">5</xref>
            ]. However, this was later reversed to the 8
quartet ground state, which is fourfold degenerate and possesses 2 orbital and 2 spin degrees
of freedom, located 46 meV below the 7 doublet state [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11 ref42 ref43">8, 39, 40</xref>
            ]. This was not able to fully
explain experimental observations, such as an anomalous change in entropy at around 30 K, seen
in specific heat data [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">25</xref>
            ], or the magnetic moment of the ground state [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30 ref44 ref45">27, 41, 42</xref>
            ]. The Raman
scattering measurements provide an explanation for these observations, indicating that the 8
quartet is further split into two doublets, 8,1 and 8,2, separated by around 30 K [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">8</xref>
            ]. The ground
state of CeB6 and its interpretation in various theoretical models is discussed in more detail in
sections and .
2.2. Magnetic structure in the antiferromagnetic phase of CeB6
          </p>
          <p>
            In zero field, CeB6 orders antiferromagnetically at a temperature TN = 2.4 K, with this phase
labelled ‘phase III’. From neutron diffraction measurements in zero field [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14 ref25 ref46 ref47">11, 22, 43, 44</xref>
            ], the AFM
1 1 0), q2 = ( 41 ¯41 0) and q01 = ( 41 41 21 ), q02 = ( 41 ¯41 21 ) have been established.
ordering vectors q1 = ( 4 4
These vectors describe a double-q, or 2q1 – q01 structure. A variety of models have been proposed to
describe the spin structure which results in these ordering vectors, with some of the earliest work
being undertaken by Effantin et al., where they proposed a transverse sine modulated non-collinear
order to describe their results [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14 ref46">11, 43</xref>
            ]. This is shown as an inset in Fig 3 (a) and reproduced in
greater detail in Fig. 3 (b), with magnetic moments found to be orthogonal and aligned along
the (110) and (11¯0) directions. This original model proposed wave amplitudes associated with
the q and q0 vectors to be almost equal, giving an ordered magnetic moment of 0.28 B at 1.3 K.
This, however, was unable to explain later SR measurements in zero field which found eight
precession frequencies for the muons, whereas the model would provide only three [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48 ref49">45, 46</xref>
            ]. Later
work by Zaharko et al. proposed a selection of new models to describe the spin pattern in the AFM
phase, with their favoured model ‘D’ shown in Fig. 3 (c) [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">44</xref>
            ]. This model was able to describe
the available neutron scattering data, could also account for the SR results and was a feasible
conclusion from theoretical predictions [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46 ref47 ref49 ref50">43, 44, 46, 47</xref>
            ]. The moments in this model are not equal,
and they are modulated along the (001) direction as well as in-plane. Using the notation of
Fig. 3 (b) the moments were found to be = 0.01 B and 0.136(7) B for the z = 0 plane and
= 0.744(16) B and 0.543(16) B for the z = 1 plane. This complicated structure is attributed to
competition between the dipolar, quadrupolar and octupolar interactions [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">44</xref>
            ].
          </p>
          <p>
            In zero field there exist three magnetic domains within the AFM state, Kyz, Kzx and Kx y ,
with the indices denoting the planes in which spins are ordered, and therefore the illustrations in
Fig. 3 are of the Kx y domain. Neutron scattering reveals that in an applied field the degeneracy
of these domains can be broken and a selection process takes place [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">43</xref>
            ]. Fig. 3 (a) shows the
field dependence of the normalised intensity of the ( 14 41 0), ( 14 ¯14 0), ( 14 14 12 ) and ( 14 ¯41 12 ) peaks as
a function of magnetic field applied along the (11¯1) direction. Whilst one would not normally
expect domain selection for a field applied along a h111i direction when the domains exist in
(001) planes, in this measurement a slight misalignment of the magnetic field direction, such that

            Bz &gt; Bx and B y , was sufficient to break the degeneracy. At low fields, the intensity of all of the
Bragg peaks in this figure increases as this domain is preferentially selected, until around 6 kOe
we are left in a single domain state and the intensity as a function of field flattens out. Further
measurements in Ref. [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">43</xref>
            ] show that a single domain is selected for fields applied along a h001i
direction, the equivalent situation to Fig. 3 (a), whilst two domains are selected for fields applied
along the h110i directions. However, this figure also indicates that at higher fields a magnetic
phase transition takes place. Here we see that the Bragg reflections at ( 14 14 0) and ( 14 14 12 ) are
sharply suppressed in an applied field of around 1 T, whilst the two other Bragg peaks remain
in higher fields and the ratio of their moments is strongly modified. This indicates a change in
magnetic structure from a double-q to a single-q type, with the new spin arrangement illustrated
as an inset to Fig. 3 (a), and this new collinear AFM phase is referred to as phase III0. The domain
selection and emergence of phase III0 are observed for all applied field directions, and have also
been seen in lanthanum doped samples [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">48</xref>
            ].
2.3. Phase II – what orders?
          </p>
          <p>
            The order parameter responsible for phase II proved difficult to determine, since it is ‘hidden’
to neutron diffraction measurements in zero field [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">22</xref>
            ]. It is stabilised by an applied magnetic field,
(1)
where
          </p>
          <p>
            HZ = 2 B
as evidenced by the enhanced transition temperature at low field, and in field dipolar moments
at the Ce3+ sites are induced, which were seen to order with a wavevector of ( 12 12 12 ) by neutron
scattering [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15 ref52">12, 49</xref>
            ]. This discovery provided a helpful clue to the origin of this phase, and was
concurrent with an antiferro-orbital ordering mechanism that was proposed for phase II [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref53">50</xref>
            ]. Since
it is related to an ordering of the quadrupolar moments, it is referred to as an antiferroquadrupolar
(AFQ) state [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref54">51</xref>
            ]. This modulation of the spins is a result of the Zeeman interaction of the 8
quartet in a magnetic field B, HZ = g B J B, where g is the Landé factor (g = 76 ) and J is the total
angular momentum. With the total angular momentum written in terms of the orbital operator
and the spin operator , the Zeeman term is written as [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref55">52</xref>
            ]

          <p>
            T x = 2 21 z, T y = 2 21 z, T z = z. (2)
For an Oxz type quadrupolar order (orbital operator 6= 0), with the magnetic field applied
along (110), an AFM dipolar moment Jz is induced [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref56">53</xref>
            ], where for low enough fields this moment
increases linearly with field and disappears in zero applied field. This has been observed in
experiment [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15 ref22 ref52">12, 19, 49</xref>
            ]. Alongside this a ferromagnetic moment is induced, seen in magnetisation
measurements [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">28</xref>
            ]. To date, the appearance of this ferromagnetic moment has not been well
studied, but inelastic neutron scattering in zero field has indicated that the system is close
to a ferromagnetic instability [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">36</xref>
            ]. Further evidence supporting AFQ order came from NMR
experiments in an applied field, where a splitting of the 11B resonance line indicated the presence
of AFQ order [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref57 ref58">54, 55</xref>
            ]. The underlying quadrupolar order, z = , results in an anisotropic
Zeeman splitting for different directions of applied magnetic field. This causes an anisotropy in
the phase diagram for the phase II – phase III boundary such that Bch001i Bch110i Bch111i and the
AFQ transition TQh001i TQh110i TQh111i [

            ]. Furthermore, the temperature dependence of
the field-induced neutron scattering intensity in the AFQ phase follows an order-parameter like
increase below TQ, preceding a suppression towards zero at lower temperatures, which suggests
that the AFM and AFQ phases are competing [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref59">56</xref>
            ].
          </p>
          <p>
            The first direct observation of orbital ordering came from resonant x-ray scattering (RXS),
where probing of the L3 edge of the Ce ion indicated a splitting of the 5d orbital, induced by
the Coulomb interaction between the 5d and 4 f orbitals upon orbital ordering [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref60 ref61">57, 58</xref>
            ]. This
ordering was found to have the same wavevector of ( 12 12 12 ) as seen from the in-field neutron
scattering measurements, which indicated that the dipole order was indeed modulated to the
underlying AFQ order. High-field measurements reveal a maximum of TQ of 10 K at around 35 T,
subsequently decreasing to about 8 K in an applied field of 60 T, with full suppression of TQ not
yet achieved [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref62">59</xref>
            ]. Theoretical models [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref63 ref64 ref65">60–62</xref>
            ] have predicted that AFQ ordering should introduce
distortions to the crystal lattice. These are expected to be small, as the quadrupole coupling to the
lattice strain is weak due to differing symmetries. In both pure and lanthanum-doped samples
a small tetragonal distortion upon the transition to the antiferromagnetic phase was noted in
magnetoelastic measurements [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref66">63</xref>
            ], however no lattice distortion on the transition to the AFQ
phase has so far been seen. For a more comprehensive discussion of multipolar ordering than will
be presented here, see for instance Refs. [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref67 ref68">64, 65</xref>
            ], as the topic is too large to cover in a dedicated
review on Ce1 x Lax B6 and has already been well described elsewhere.
2.4. Mean-field description of the ordering phenomena in CeB6
          </p>
          <p>
            Compounds with 3d or 4f ions show not only common types of dipolar magnetic order but
are also able to express multipolar order from the available orbital degrees of freedom. The AFQ
phase in CeB6 is of similar character, however it displays some unusual behaviour and describing
this theoretically has been far from straightforward. In an applied magnetic field the AFQ phase
stabilises with increasing magnetic field, with TQ showing a positive slope at low field (see Fig. 1).
Several mechanisms were proposed to explain this unusual behaviour of TQ(B) at low field. In their
early work characterising the phase diagram, Effantin et al. proposed that the magnetic properties
of CeB6 were dominated by the interplay between single-site Kondo fluctuations and the magnetic
and quadrupolar interactions. Here, the dense Kondo state suppresses the indirect interactions
which establish AFQ order, leading to the reduction of TQ in zero field. With increasing field the
Kondo state is suppressed and the AFQ ordering is enhanced, leading to the positive slope of TQ
at low field. Contrastingly, Hanzawa and Kasuya [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref53">50</xref>
            ] constructed a mean-field model assuming
a ground-state 7 doublet and an excited 8 quartet, where the interaction was dominated by
quadrupole-quadruple coupling between the neighbouring cerium ions in a simple two-sublattice
model. This model was able to reproduce the phase diagram and explain a variety of experimental
results, although the authors noted that there were aspects of the known behaviour of CeB6
that they were unable to reproduce, such as the 11B line splitting from NMR measurements, and
attributed these discrepancies to over-simplification of their level scheme. As discussed in section ,
it was discovered that this level scheme was not correct [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43 ref56">40, 53</xref>
            ], and so later studies tended to
restrict themselves to the 8 ground state only.
          </p>
          <p>
            A contrasting explanation, proposed by Ohkawa et al., was based on the RKKY interaction
between neighbouring 8 orbitals rather than the quadrupole interaction, derived from a simplified
periodic Anderson model [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref54 ref55">51, 52</xref>
            ]. From this, higher-order interactions originating from spin and
orbital degeneracies were responsible for the enhancement of TQ at low fields. More recently,
Uimin et al. demonstrated that a large fluctuation of the quadrupole moment at low fields would
lead to a reduction in TQ [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref69">66</xref>
            ], and it is the suppression of these fluctuations with increasing
field that allows the AFQ phase to stabilise. Whilst these proposed mechanisms were able to
explain individual aspects of the phase diagram of CeB6, none gave a complete description of
the known behaviour. Critically, in an applied field in the AFQ phase the cerium moments order
antiferromagnetically with an ordering vector of q = ( 21 21 21 ). This indicates that the induced AFM
is modulated according to the AFQ order, which can be seen by neutron diffraction [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15 ref22 ref46 ref56">12, 19, 43, 53</xref>
            ].
However, NMR results appeared to contradict this showing a splitting of the 11B signal that
could not be simply explained by this ordering vector, but instead suggested an AFQ order
with a triple-q structure [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref58">55</xref>
            ]. Various theoretical studies within the mean-field approach were
conducted to resolve such problems, developing a coherent picture of the low-temperature phase
diagram [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref56 ref63 ref70 ref71 ref72 ref73">53, 60, 67–70</xref>
            ].
          </p>
          <p>
            Within the model of Shiina et al. which treats the system as a well isolated 8 ground state
there are 15 supported multipolar moments – 3 dipolar, 5 quadrupolar and 7 octupolar [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref56 ref63">53, 60</xref>
            ].
Of the 5 quadrupolar moments within the 8 quartet, two are of the 3-type and three are of
the 5-type, and in zero field it is expected that only the 5-type (Ox y , Oyz, Ozx ) ordering will be
realized in zero field. A schematic diagram of the Ox y order is presented in Fig. 4 (d), which
represents the orientation of the quadrupolar moments in the xy plane with the applied magnetic
field along the z axis. This model also predicts that the application of magnetic field will “select”
quadrupolar moments, due to the lowering of the symmetry of the system by dipolar ordering,
such that a field applied along the (001) direction would result in the realisation of only Ox y
order, as depicted in Fig. 4 (d), whilst Oyz + Ozx is realised for a field along the (110) direction,
and the system remains in an Ox y + Oyz + Ozx state for fields applied along h111i. To resolve the
disagreement between the conclusions from neutron scattering and NMR, Sakai et al. performed
a mean-field calculation within this model, considering ordering of the Ox y quadrupoles in an
applied field along (001), where the coexisting Tx yz AF octupolar interaction was present [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref70">67</xref>
            ].
Here they proposed that the NMR results can be explained by this model if the octupolar moments
are included in the calculation, concluding that in this case that the Ox y quadrupolar ordering
is sufficient to describe both the neutron diffraction and NMR results and the complex triple-q
structure initially suggested from the NMR study [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref58">55</xref>
            ] is not required.
          </p>
          <p>
            To provide a more complete description for the behaviour of phases II and III, Sera et al.
performed a similar mean-field calculation in the ‘4 sublattice’ model, where to consider the
consecutive ordering of the quadrupoles and spins, cerium sites were divided into two Ox y
quadrupolar sublattices, split by the Tx yz octupolar interaction, which are then further subdivided
into two spin sublattices [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref74">71</xref>
            ]. This Hamiltonian was also considered in the mean field approach,
and from this the authors were able to successfully describe several properties of CeB6. The
unusual increase of TQ(B) at low field is understood to be a consequence of field-induced octupolar
moments, seen in Fig. 4 (a), stabilising the AFQ phase. This was also inferred experimentally from
the field dependence of the RXS signal at qAFQ, seen in Fig. 4 (c), whereby the Oyz Ozx form
factor increases with applied field. We can see from a comparison of the theory data in Fig. 4 (a,b)
and the experimental RXS data in panel (c) of the same figure that this model is able to predict
the behaviour of the multipolar moments in CeB6. Direct comparison here is not possible as the
magnetic field is along different crystal directions, although the general form of the model closely
follows the available data. They discovered that the antiferro-ordering of the Ox y quadrupoles
and the Tx yz octupoles favours a ferromagnetic spin alignment. This directly competes with the
antiferromagnetic exchange interaction that may explain unusual features of the phase diagram,
such as the convex shape of the AFQ Bragg intensity as a function of applied field [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref75">72</xref>
            ]. In addition,
ferromagnetic spin correlations have been observed above TQ by magnetization measurements
and it has been proposed that these are induced by short-range ordering of the quadrupoles and
octupoles [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref76">73</xref>
            ].
          </p>
          <p>
            Whilst the mean-field models discussed in this section have provided a reasonable description
of much of the behaviour of CeB6, they do have difficulties when describing static quantities
such as the low-field magnetisation and transport properties. The mean-field calculations of
Sera et al. suggest a zero-field crossing of the field-induced AFM moment as a function of field
and temperature, which is not observed [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref52 ref59 ref74">49, 56, 71</xref>
            ]. A metamagnetic-like double step in the
low-temperature magnetisation, most pronounced for the field applied along h110i, is also not
explained in these theories [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">48</xref>
            ]. Perhaps most importantly, the model neglects the formation
of heavy-fermion quasiparticles in the ground state of CeB6, which are observed by transport
measurements. Recent neutron experiments by Friemel et al. and Jang et al. have shown that,
contrary to the expectations of many established theoretical descriptions of CeB6, the itinerant
electrons also play an important role in the spin dynamics of the system [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39 ref77">36, 74</xref>
            ], and we have
reserved discussion on this for section . This somewhat suggests that the localised f -electron
picture adopted by many mean-field descriptions may not be appropriate, which will be discussed
in section .
2.5. Electronic properties of CeB6
          </p>
          <p>
            Transport properties provide an important probe for the investigation into the role of
heavyfermion physics in CeB6. Resistivity as a function of temperature for six different samples of
Ce1 x Lax B6 is shown in Fig. 5 (a), with lanthanum concentrations ranging from x = 0 to
x = 0.97 [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref78">75</xref>
            ]. The behaviour of the resistivity shows a continual change as a function of
lanthanum doping, and at intermediate temperatures all concentrations exhibit the logarithmic
scaling (T ) = log(T =TK), where TK is the Kondo temperature, which was found for the dilute
samples to be around 1 K. This scaling is expected for the single-ion Kondo effect, and for low
concentrations the resistivity drops at low temperatures, signalling the onset of the coherent Kondo
state. The decrease in resistivity at intermediate temperatures is coupled to TQ, illustrated for CeB6
in Fig. 5 (b) by measurements in applied magnetic fields, where the temperature of maximum
resistivity Tmax increases with TQ. At the lowest temperatures the resistivity follows a Fermi-liquid
(FL) behaviour, (T ) / T 2 [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref78">75</xref>
            ]. The magnetoresistance shows a decrease for fields B &gt; BN,
which would be considered typical for the incoherent Kondo effect since it suppresses scattering
of conduction electrons by the f -electrons [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10 ref31">7, 28</xref>
            ]. In the AFM phase, the magnetoresistance
is weakly positive, which is common for the ground state of heavy-fermion systems. However,
the clear feature in the magnetoresistance at the AFM/AFQ boundary and the rapid decrease in
resistivity within the AFQ state indicates that the removal of scattering is related to the ordering
of the quadrupoles, indicating that a purely heavy-fermion approach to describing the transport
properties is insufficient, and that the localised correlated behaviour in CeB6 plays and important
role.
          </p>
          <p>
            From the zero-temperature extrapolation of specific heat, the Sommerfield coefficient for CeB6
is found to be strongly enhanced when compared to the nonmagnetic LaB6 [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref80">77</xref>
            ]. This indicates
correlated quasiparticles, however since the decrease in resistivity follows TQ, it is difficult to define
an onset temperature, T , for these correlations. Under the application of pressure it is found
that the maximum temperature of resistivity, Tmax, increases beyond TQ [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">13</xref>
            ]. This is expected,
because pressure increases the hybridisation between f -electrons and the conduction electrons and
therefore promotes coherence between the f -states. However, it also illustrates that the coherent
heavy-fermion ground states and the AFQ phase are not necessarily connected, since the AFQ
transition temperature TQ remains nearly constant under pressure [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref78">75</xref>
            ].
          </p>
          <p>
            The Fermi surface of CeB6, shown in Fig. 5 (c), is rather similar to other hexaborides such as
LaB6 and PrB6 [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref81 ref82">78, 79</xref>
            ]. It consists of ellipsoidal electron pockets centred at the X points. Further,
it has been systematically studied as a function of doping in Ce1 x Lax B6 by quantum-oscillation
measurements [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref79 ref81 ref82 ref83 ref84 ref85 ref86 ref87 ref88 ref89">76,78–86</xref>
            ]. The carrier density was found to increase with the cerium concentration,
indicating at least a partial contribution to the Fermi surface from the f -electrons [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref83">80</xref>
            ]. The high
magnetic fields required for these studies put the system in the AFQ state, and the quasiparticle mass
m was found to decrease with increasing field. For varying cerium concentrations, the effective
mass diverges as the applied magnetic field is lowered towards the phase II-III0 boundary, BQ [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref83">80</xref>
            ],
with the effective mass exhibiting a continuous increase upon increasing cerium concentration [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref85">82</xref>
            ].

            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref80">77</xref>
            ].
Owing to the high magnetic fields required for dHvA experiments, they were unable to access
either phase III or phase III0 of CeB6, which have low critical fields of Bc = 1.1 T and BQ = 1.7 T,
respectively. However, the related compounds PrB6 and NdB6 have much higher critical fields
for phases III or phase III0, and have been studied by this technique [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref90 ref91 ref92">87–89</xref>
            ]. Across the phase
III transition the Fermi surface was seen to change drastically, resembling that of LaB6 in the
paramagnetic state, and their effective masses in the paramagnetic state are comparable to
CeB6 [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref91 ref92">88, 89</xref>
            ]. However, for both compounds no significant increase of the quasiparticle mass
towards the critical field Bc was observed, and instead the low effective mass across the whole
available field range has been attributed to a much weaker hybridisation between the conduction
electrons and f -electrons [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref91 ref92">88, 89</xref>
            ]. It has been found in CeB6 that magnetic ordering in the
AFM state reconstructs the Fermi surface. Point-contact spectroscopy and scanning tunnelling
spectroscopy have found indications for a small charge gap of AFM 0.6 meV opening below
TN [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref93">90</xref>
            ]. The structure of this reconstructed Fermi surface, however, remains elusive. Whilst the
main sheet of the Fermi surface in PrB6 and NdB6 is spherical [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref93">90</xref>
            ], the contrasting behaviour of
the f -electron states and effective masses render us unable to draw a strong comparison between
this and the corresponding Fermi surface of CeB6.
          </p>
          <p>We see that CeB6 shows FL-like behaviour in its transport properties at low temperatures,
both in the AFM and AFQ phases. The large linear specific-heat coefficient at low fields and the
large effective mass of the charge carriers, determined at high field, indicate that heavy fermions
are contributing to the transport. However, the localised f -spins magnetically order in the
lowtemperature AFM phase in a manner analogous to PrB6 and NdB6, which both have a different
behaviour of the f -states and the quasiparticle effective mass.

coherent heavy-fermion ground state at low temperatures, can be resolved by the two-fluid model
of the Kondo lattice [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref96 ref97">93, 94</xref>
            ]. Previously, the description of heavy electron materials has treated the
system as a set of localised magnetic moments weakly coupled to the itinerant electron band by the
AFM interaction. Whilst the single-site impurity problem has been successfully solved to describe
the Kondo effect which emerges at low temperatures, complex inter-site interactions hindered the
applicability of a model of the Kondo lattice. Nakatsuji et al. set out to solve this by developing an
appropriate two-fluid model [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref96">93</xref>
            ]. The Kondo system has three important energy scales: the
singleion Kondo temperature TK, the inter-site coupling temperature scale T and the crystal-electric-field
splitting. They find that a coherent state emerges when crossing the temperature T : a
heavyelectron fluid. This it similar to the two-fluid model for superfluid helium, where the heavy electron
fluid is analogous to the superfluid and the non-interacting Kondo centres, or Kondo impurity fluid,
is analogous to the normal-state fluid. The relative fraction, f (T ), of the coherent state undertakes
the role of an order parameter, increasing linearly with decreasing temperature until saturating at
a value of 0.9 [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref96">93</xref>
            ]. In this description, both localised and heavy-fermion quasiparticles contribute
to the magnetic properties below the inter-site coherence temperature T . Various consequences
of this can be seen in experiment, such as the deviation from linear scaling between the spin part
of the Knight-shift, Kspin, and the susceptibility [Fig. 6 (a,b)]. Here, the local response, KL, and
the response of the hybridized quasiparticles HF contribute differently to the susceptibility and
to Kspin below T , which has been observed in CeB6 below T 10 K [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref94 ref98">91, 95</xref>
            ]. It has been claimed
that this temperature corresponds to the onset of magnetic scattering at ( 12 21 12 ) [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref99">96</xref>
            ], which has
been later shown to originate from spin fluctuations without any sharp transition [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref100">97</xref>
            ]. At low
temperatures, Raman scattering studies have observed the splitting of the 8 ground state into two
doublets, separated by E8,1 E8,2 30 K [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">8</xref>
            ]. This splitting was not observed in inelastic neutron
scattering measurements for T &gt; TQ, although this is probably due to a vanishing matrix element
for the transition [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref101 ref42">39, 98</xref>
            ]. Should this be related to short-range quadrupole order, an additional
splitting into two transitions upon the application of a magnetic field would be expected from the
different Landé g-factors for the two Ce3+ sites. However, only one orbital ordering resonance,
in an applied field of Bres = 2.8 T, was seen in electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements.
This resonance is coincident with the AFQ phase, appearing below TQ(Bres) = 4.7 K, as seen in
Fig. 6 (c) [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref102 ref95">92, 99</xref>
            ]. The presence of only a single resonance was attributed to the hybridization of
conduction and f -electrons, which averages out the two g-factors into a single uniform g-factor,
determined by experiment to be g = 1.6 [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref102 ref103 ref95">92, 99, 100</xref>
            ]. This ESR study also indicated the presence
of ferromagnetic correlations. Attributing the single resonance to hybridised quasiparticles is in
accordance with the observation of similar resonances in several other heavy-fermion compounds,
such as YbRh2Si2 and CeRuPO, which also exhibit ferromagnetic correlations [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref104">101</xref>
            ], although
this interpretation contradicts the multipolar mean-field model that interprets the f -electrons as
localised states. It is important to note that a second magnetic resonance has been seen at much
higher fields [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref105">102</xref>
            ], but is not considered within the discussion of Ref. [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref103">100</xref>
            ]. Its origin has yet to be
determined, although it is postulated that the appearance of this mode within the high-frequency
range may indicate a change in the magnetic structure of CeB6 at high field [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref105">102</xref>
            ].
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the two-fluid Kondo description is not without its problems. Various charge
transport [

            ] measurements have shown deviations in

behaviour from that expected by the Kondo description for both CeB6 and lanthanum-doped
samples. They find that, in contrast to the majority of the Ce-based Kondo lattices, the Hall
coefficient RH is both negative and nearly independent of temperature and applied magnetic
field between 4.2 300 K [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">40</xref>
            ], which goes against the predictions of the skew-scattering models
for dense Kondo systems [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref109 ref110">106, 107</xref>
            ]. An alternative explanation was proposed in the transport
and magnetisation study by Sluchanko et al. [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">28</xref>
            ]. In the temperature region TQ &lt; T &lt; 7 K the
susceptibility and the Hall coefficient RH appear correlated, with the ratio of =RH seen in the
inset of Fig. 6 (d) remaining flat at these temperatures. Here, they are successfully described by
the relation
          </p>
          <p>
            The corresponding energy ESP=kB 3.3 K 1 was associated with the formation of spin polarons.
They propose, therefore, that below TQ a transition to a spin-density-wave (SDW) state of the
conduction electrons frees the local moments, which leads to the observed enhancement of the
magnetic response. In low fields, the AFM state would then be competing with the SDW state due
to the antiferromagnetic coupling of the localised spins. This polarises the conduction electrons
via the RKKY interaction. The same group has also conducted a more recent study of the transport
properties of dilute Ce1 x Lax B6 solid solutions with x 0.99, where they find the Kondo-impurity
model unable to explain their results, and instead argue that heavy-fermion states of the
spinpolaron type are formed near the Ce impurities [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref111">108</xref>
            ]. Inelastic neutron scattering may be able
to resolve these questions, since it is able to see charge gaps associated with SDW order, and as
discussed in the next section, a possible signature of a SDW has already been seen in neutron
diffraction.
2.7. Interplay between the competing order parameters of the low-temperature phases
          </p>
          <p>
            Quadrupolar ordering is not visible under neutron scattering in zero magnetic field as the
neutron can only be scattered from time-reversal-symmetry breaking fields [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref113">110</xref>
            ]. Until recently,
neutron scattering at the quadrupolar ordering vector, qAFQ, has only been observed under an
applied field, attributed to ordering of the dipole moments modulated to the underlying AFQ
order [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14 ref15 ref52 ref55 ref59">11, 12, 49, 52, 56</xref>
            ]. Surprisingly, however, neutron spin-flip scattering measurements,
reproduced here in Fig. 7 (a) [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref99">96</xref>
            ], observed a signal at qAFQ in zero field. This signal appears
below T = 7 K, rising to a peak at TN before being suppressed within the AFM phase. Within
the statistical fluctuations of the data it appears unperturbed by the AFQ transition. Following
this, more recent elastic neutron scattering measurements have also seen a small signal at the
AFQ ordering vector, reproduced here in Fig. 7 (b). However, the temperature dependence of this
signal is in contrast to the earlier spin-flip data, with intensity only appearing below the critical
temperature TAFQ [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref77">74</xref>
            ]. The Bragg peak at the AFQ ordering vector is more than an order of
magnitude weaker than its counterpart at qAFM, and shows a sharp increase from zero between TQ
and TN before being lightly suppressed in the AFM phase. The apparently contradicting behaviours
of the spin-flip scattering data of panel (a) and the nonpolarized elastic neutron scattering data of
panel (b) can be reconciled by considering the difference in energy resolutions, as explained in
Fig. 7 (c) [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref112">109</xref>
            ]. This figure juxtaposes two data sets from different experiments, performed on

the same sample at two triple-axis spectrometers of the Institute Laue Langevin (ILL, Grenoble),
one with a neutron wave vector kf = 1.4 Å 1 (cold-neutron IN14 spectrometer) and the other
with kf = 2.662 Å 1 (thermal-neutron IN3 spectrometer). Both the old polarized-neutron data
and our nonpolarized INS data measured with kf = 2.662 Å 1 show a signal above TQ, whilst
cold-neutron measurements (identical to those shown in panel (b) of Fig. 7) show no signal at
the AFQ wavevector until passing below TQ. Whilst the presence of an elastic neutron scattering
signal at the AFQ wavevector in no applied field is an unexpected result by itself, the apparent
disagreement among the two experiments indicates that there is more than one contribution to
neutron scattering at this wavevector. When comparing the kf = 2.662 Å 1 and kf = 1.4 Å 1 data
in panel (c), it is important to note that the cold-neutron measurement benefited from a better
energy resolution. As it is now known that low-energy quasielastic scattering is peaked at the AFQ
wave vector and is present above TQ, in both thermal-neutron elastic measurements the broad
energy resolution leads to an additional diffuse contribution to the peak that is magnetic in origin
and therefore seen both in nonpolarized- and polarized-neutron data. However, the resolution of
a cold-neutron spectrometer is sufficient to separate the true Bragg scattering below TQ from the
quasielastic contribution. Below TN, the quasielastic signal is gapped, which leads to a suppression
of the intensity and a reported sharpening of the elastic peak [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref99">96</xref>
            ]. The higher resolution data
from panels (b) and (c), however, have a comparable q-width to the AFM Bragg peaks, implying
that this signal is related predominantly to the long-range static magnetic ordering. Assuming that
the minor suppression of intensity below TN could be still related to the spin-gap opening in the
quasielastic signal, this observation suggests that phase II is not suppressed by the onset of AFM
order and hence coexists with it without competition. Moreover, the presence of a Bragg peak at
( 12 12 12 ), albeit weak in comparison to the AFM Bragg peaks, indicates that something in addition to
AFQ ordering is taking place in zero field.
          </p>
          <p>
            The weak contribution to the magnetic Bragg intensity in the zero-field data of Fig. 7 is also
seen in Fig. 8 (b). Fig. 8 shows the field dependence of the Bragg intensity at qAFQ from two
separate experiments. The early data in Fig. 8 (a) [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref52">49</xref>
            ] show the magnetic Bragg intensity at ( 12 12 12 )
as a function of field at both 1.65 K and 2.75 K. At 1.65 K the system is in the AFM state at zero
field, and initially shows no signal until the AFQ phase is reached, whilst at 2.75 K the system is
already in the AFQ phase in zero field and the intensity appears to increase from zero as a function
of applied field. This signal arises from the field-induced dipolar moments, modulated to the
(a)
(b) 5.0
underlying AFQ order. More recent low-temperature data from the neutron-scattering study of
Ref. [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref112">109</xref>
            ], reproduced in Fig. 8 (b), show scattering at T = 0.4 K from both the AFM and AFQ
wavevectors, where the inset shows an expanded low-field region. Here we can see that there is
actually very weak magnetic Bragg scattering in the AFM state at ( 12 12 12 ), now visible in the newer
data because of a better signal-to-noise ratio. It is independent of applied field within the AFM
phase, being unperturbed by the phase III – III0 phase boundary at Bc = 1.1 T. Only above 1.5 T,
upon entering phase II, the intensity of this peak begins to increase linearly with applied field,
as reported previously. Although the localised multipolar ordering model is able to explain the
increasing intensity in the AFQ state in applied magnetic field as originating from dipole ordering
modulated to the AFQ order, it is unable to explain the flat intensity at the AFQ wavevector seen
within phase III [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref112 ref14 ref59">11, 56, 109</xref>
            ]. This suggests that this signal may have a different origin, and
has been suggested to come from a SDW formed from itinerant quasiparticles as opposed to
the localised f -electrons [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref112">109</xref>
            ], which would correlate with the conclusions of Sluchanko et al.
discussed in section . Still, the disappearance of the SDW peak at TQ strongly indicates that it
is linked to the AFQ order parameter or is even induced by it. It is evident here that there is a
multitude of competing order parameters within the low temperature region of CeB6, which in
some cases appear to co-exist or compete, arising from the complex interplay of the itinerant and
more localised f -electron physics.
2.8. Spin dynamics in CeB6
          </p>
          <p>
            The mean-field descriptions, discussed in section , are able to predict the formation of collective
multipolar modes associated with the ordering of the quadrupoles. Thalmeier et al. considered this
model, assuming a symmetric interaction term and calculated the dipolar scattering function in both
the random-phase approximation (RPA) from the local multipolar susceptibility [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref71 ref72 ref73">68–70</xref>
            ] and in the
Holstein-Primakoff approach [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref114">111</xref>
            ]. These calculations predict, in zero field, a Goldstone mode at
the point from a dispersion branch that extends across the whole Brillouin zone [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref71 ref72 ref73">68–70</xref>
            ], as shown
in Fig. 9 (a). All modes were found to increase linearly with field to the first approximation [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref71">68</xref>
            ],
an example is given in Fig. 9 (b). INS measurements by Bouvet et al. [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref101">98</xref>
            ] and Regnault et al. [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref115">112</xref>
            ]
find dispersing excitations along lines of high symmetry in applied magnetic fields of 4 T and 6 T
parallel to the (001) direction. Two representative comparisons between the measurements of
Reganult et al. and the calculations of Shiina et al. are shown in Fig. 9 (c,d) [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref114">111</xref>
            ], demonstrating a
reasonable agreement near the point that becomes less satisfactory near the X point at the zone
boundary. It was concluded that the theory describes the “leading” mode in the spectrum in field,
however zero-field experiments found a featureless quasielastic response [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref101">98</xref>
            ] which disagrees
with the calculations. Until recently, however, the INS data were limited in their coverage of
Q-space and, furthermore, these studies focussed on the AFQ phase, with few measurements taken
in the AFM state.
          </p>
          <p>
            More recent neutron scattering measurements provided a more complete description of the
spin excitation spectrum of CeB6. Recent developments in neutron-spectrometer instrumentations
have allowed Friemel et al. and Jang et al. to re-investigate the spectra under improved
energy resolution throughout a greater proportion of reciprocal space, both in the AFM and
AFQ states [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39 ref77">36, 74</xref>
            ]. A broad summary of their data, consisting of constant-energy maps in
reciprocal space along the (H H L) plane is shown in Fig. 10 (a,b) at energies of 0.25 and 0.5 meV,
respectively. This spectrum consists of several key features. Firstly, within the AFM state there is a
strong signal at the R points, most intense in the 0.5 meV map, which comes from the resonant
exciton mode initially reported by Friemel et al. [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref77">74</xref>
            ]. The appearance of this resonant exciton is
contradictory to the naive expectation that the spin dynamics in phase III would be dominated
by collective modes emanating from the AFM ordering vectors q1 = ( 41 14 0) and q01 = ( 41 41 21 ). This
exciton peak, centred at an energy of ~h!R = 0.48 meV, develops with an order-parameter-like
behaviour below TN with a simultaneous broadening of the resonance. The development of this
strong mode at the R( 12 12 12 ) point, is accompanied by the opening of a spin gap below 0.35 meV.
This R-point mode bears a strong resemblance to the resonant modes observed in various
heavyfermion and high-Tc superconductors [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref116 ref117 ref118 ref119">113–116</xref>
            ]. These modes are understood to be excitons that
form below the onset of a particle-hole continuum (within the particle-hole energy gap) due to
a divergence in the dynamical spin susceptibility derived from itinerant models within the RPA.
For CeB6, a charge gap has been observed in the AFM state with a size 2 AFM 1.2 meV from
point-contact spectroscopy, reproduced in Fig. 11 (a) [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref93">90</xref>
            ]. This suggests that the mode at ~h!R lies
inside this charge gap and is therefore consistent with the exciton picture. However, the resonant
mode in unconventional superconductors is confined to the wavevector of the magnetic Bragg
peak, whereas within the AFM phase of CeB6 an exciton-like feature can be seen at a number of
wavevectors, reaching a maximum of intensity at the ( 21 12 12 ) point.
          </p>
          <p>Further support for the opening of the charge gap comes from the neutron-spectroscopy data
themselves, showing that in the AFM state a second, broader peak at the R point, indicated by

the arrow in Fig. 11 (b), may signal the onset of the particle-hole continuum [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">15</xref>
            ]. This peak,
found between 0.95 meV and 1.05 meV, is close in energy to the gap measured by point-contact
spectroscopy [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref93">90</xref>
            ]. An alternative explanation for this peak such as a crystal-field excitation can be
excluded as the peak is seen to disappear as the temperature passes above TN [Fig. 11 (c)], with
the spectra in the AFQ state taking on a quasielastic lineshape with no high-energy mode [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref100">97</xref>
            ].
          </p>
          <p>
            The development of a resonant exciton mode in the AFM phase is not predicted by the
standard interacting-multipole model of CeB6, which would have anticipated that the magnetic
response in the AFM phase be dominated by the magnetic dipole moments of the localised Ce
electrons [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref120 ref56 ref72">53, 69, 117</xref>
            ]. However, the presence of this resonant mode can be understood in terms
of a two-component model that includes strong interactions between the localised magnetic
moments and the itinerant electrons [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref121">118</xref>
            ]. Here, the formation of the AFM state results in the
opening of a gap in the electronic density of states, leading to a nearly isotropic spin gap in
the magnetic spectrum originating from strongly hybridised crystal-field excitations of the Ce
4f -electrons and the itinerant conduction electrons. The resonant mode observed in the neutron
scattering measurements can then be considered as a collective mode below the onset of a
particlehole continuum, in a similar manner to the current models describing the resonant modes in
unconventional superconductors [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref116 ref117 ref118 ref119">113–116</xref>
            ]. Further, CeB6 is not the only hexaboride to show a
resonant exciton in its magnetic excitation spectrum, with recent neutron scattering measurements
on SmB6 showing similar 14 meV exciton modes at the X and R high symmetry points [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref122">119</xref>
            ].
          </p>
          <p>
            A further surprising development in the exploration of the spin dynamics of the AFM phase
was the observation of ferromagnetic fluctuations by time-of-flight neutron scattering. Jang et al.
discovered an intense and dispersive low-energy mode originating from the (110) and (001)
points [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">36</xref>
            ], which can be seen clearly in the reciprocal space map of Fig. 10 (a), with its dispersion
along the X X line reproduced in panel (c) of the same figure. Its temperature dependence
indicates that it cannot originate from the acoustic phonon modes, but rather is magnetic in origin,
and it has a parabolic dispersion which is expected for ferromagnetic spin waves. The dispersion of
this mode, spanning the whole Brillouin zone, is continuously connected to the exciton-like peaks
that were observed previously for a number of wavevectors using triple-axis spectrometers [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref100">97</xref>
            ].
Within the AFQ state the scattering becomes quasielastic throughout the Brillouin zone, with
intensity peaked at the , X and R points rather than the AFM ordering vectors q1 = ( 41 41 0) and
q01 = ( 41 14 21 ). The intense dispersing modes seen in the AFM phase should therefore be associated
with the itinerant quasiparticles, whose scattering function in q-space is defined by the nesting
vectors of the paramagnetic Fermi surface. This is similar to the spin dynamics in the hidden-order
compound URu2Si2, where spin excitations pre-exist as paramagnons in the paramagnetic phase
before becoming visible as dispersing modes upon transition into the hidden-order phase [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref123">120</xref>
            ].
          </p>
          <p>
            In zero field, the proposed AFQ ordering of the Ox y quadrupole moments with the
antiferrocoupling of the Tx yz octupolar moments favours a ferromagnetic alignment of the dipoles [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref114 ref72">69,111</xref>
            ].
However, this theory proposes that the dispersing magnon modes would already be visible in
the AFQ state, at odds with the neutron-scattering observations. Similarly, the exciton at ( 12 12 12 )
would be expected to be a damped crystal-field-like multipolar excitation within these descriptions,
instead of the observed change to quasielastic scattering upon entering the AFQ state. Furthermore,
this weakly q-dependent quasielastic scattering has its linewidth minima at the R, and X points.
This suggests a correlation between the quasielastic linewidth in the AFQ state and magnon energy
in the AFM state, indicating that the strongly damped signal in the AFQ phase already carries
important information about the collective modes that form below TN. These observations call for
a re-examination of the theoretical description, which is discussed in section .
          </p>
          <p>
            The neutron scattering studies were also able to investigate the spin waves associated with
the AFM ordering [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">36</xref>
            ]. They found a cone-shaped dispersion emanating from the ( 14 14 21 ) and
equivalent vectors, resembling the spin waves expected for a Heisenberg antiferromagnet. The
spin-wave bands are restricted to low energies (&lt; 0.8 meV) and a narrow Q-space range around
the ordering wave vectors.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the most recent measurements, Friemel et al. have extended their investigation of the
resonant mode at the R point to include the effects of both lanthanum doping and applied field [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">15</xref>
            ].
Whilst their initial findings of regarding this resonant mode in pure CeB6 under no applied field
led to the suggestion that the localised description of the spin dynamics was insufficient and
it was necessary to account for the effect of itinerant heavy-quasiparticles in the system (see
section ), under applied field they find a crossover from an itinerant regime in the AFM phase to a
more localised one above BQ. Their data show that the resonant mode at the R point disappears
above the critical field of the AFM phase, and that this is followed by the formation of two other
modes whose energies grow linearly with magnetic field when entering the AFQ phase. This
field behaviour occurs for all the lanthanum dopings, x = 0, 0.18, 0.23, 0.28 in Ce1 x Lax B6, and
resembles a transition between two Zeeman-split energy levels, consistent with a purely localised
description of the spin dynamics within a mean-field approach of ordered multipoles [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref71">68</xref>
            ].
          </p>
          <p>Concluding, the zero-field neutron scattering studies of Friemel et al. and Jang et al. uncovered
some surprising behaviour. In total, one can distinguish three distinct types of low-energy magnetic
excitations, possessing their own local maxima of intensity in momentum space: the ferromagnetic
mode at the point, the resonant exciton mode at the R point and spin-wave modes at the AFM
wavevectors. Both the resonant mode at the R point and the low-energy ferromagnetic fluctuations
at the point were unexpected, as they were not predicted by prevailing theories of the interacting
multipolar moments of CeB6 and call for a re-examination of the interplay between the competing
interactions within this material.
2.9. Itinerant description of the spin dynamics.</p>
          <p>
            The above-mentioned INS results [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39 ref77">36, 74</xref>
            ] are at odds with the expected behaviour from
established theories. In the AFQ state only quasielastic scattering is observed, instead of the
dispersive collective modes expected from the multipolar model [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref71">68</xref>
            ] (see Fig. 9). In zero field,
spin excitations only appear within the AFM phase, revealing both spin waves emanating from
the AFM Bragg peaks and a strong dispersing ferromagnetic mode at the point alongside
exciton-like modes at the R and X points. Similar modes are recurring phenomena, found in
the superconducting state of heavy-fermion superconductors [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref118 ref119">115, 116</xref>
            ], Kondo insulators such
as SmB6 [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref124">121</xref>
            ] and YbB12 [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref125 ref126">122, 123</xref>
            ] as well as the hidden order phase of URu2Si2 [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref123 ref127">120, 124</xref>
            ]
and now CeB6. It also appears that the appearance of these modes is somewhat independent of
the exact ground state of the system in question: From the “1-2-10" family both CeRu2Al10 and
CeFe2Al10 display such modes, with the former being an antiferromagnet and the latter a Kondo
insulator. Most importantly, following the work of Ohkawa [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref55">52</xref>
            ], the ordering phenomena in
CeB6 have been considered in the localised picture of f -electron multipoles. Whilst this approach
has been able to describe a large body of the experimental data (see section ), the recent INS
measurements by Friemel et al. [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref100">97</xref>
            ] and Jang et al. [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">36</xref>
            ] indicate that the spectral weight of spin
fluctuations predominantly originates from itinerant magnetic moments. This challenge to the
localised picture is in accordance with the heavy-fermion character of CeB6: Its large effective
mass m &gt; 20m0 [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref81 ref83 ref84">78, 80, 81</xref>
            ], where m0 is the bare electron mass, and its Kondo temperature of
1 K that is of a similar order to TN and TQ may cast doubt on the validity of treating CeB6 with a
localised 4f approach.
          </p>
          <p>
            To overcome these shortcomings in the existing theories, Akbari et al. [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref120">117</xref>
            ] have considered
CeB6 in terms of the microscopic fourfold degenerate 8-type Anderson lattice model. Here, the
AFQ and AFM order parameters are treated as particle-hole condensates in the itinerant
heavyquasiparticle picture, and the resonant mode from the INS measurements [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref100">97</xref>
            ] is interpreted
as a feedback spin exciton, where the feedback effect results in a change in magnetic spectral
properties across a respective transition due to the appearance of an order parameter. To ensure
single occupancy of the f -orbitals, they assume an infinite on-site Coulomb repulsion, and find the
main effect of the AFQ and AFM ordering on the conduction electrons is to create charge gaps at
the respective ordering vectors. Within the RPA formalism, they evaluate an expression for the
dynamic susceptibility for the interacting quasiparticles RPA(q, !):
          </p>
          <p>RPA(q, !) = 1 J0q(q0,(!q),!) , (4)
where they take the heavy quasiparticle interaction term Jq to have a Lorentzian form centred
at the exciton wavevector. The charge gaps that appear in the AFQ and AFM phases have the effect
of pushing the quasiparticle response to higher energies, and if the condition Jq0 0(q0, !) = 1 is
met, then the RPA susceptibility manifests a pole at q = q0. It is suggested that this condition is
satisfied in the AFM state of CeB6, which explains the sharp exciton feature seen at the R-point in
inelastic neutron scattering.</p>
          <p>
            Whilst this model is successful in explaining the observation of the R-point resonance in
the INS measurements, there are still several open questions regarding these results. Firstly,
the origin of the interaction Jq is left open, being either direct exchange or an RKKY-mediated
dipolar or quadrupolar interaction. Secondly, an alternative approach is conceivable, which was
used to describe the resonant mode in CeCoIn5 [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref128">125</xref>
            ]. It describes excitons such as the one
observed by the INS study as localised magnon-like excitations. This description of the resonant
modes in unconventional superconductors finds the magnon-like excitations appearing at the
antiferromagnetic wavevector only after the opening of the energy gap in the charge channel, as
this removes damping by particle-hole excitations and thus allows them to form as sharp modes
from an overdamped continuum. For CeB6, the gap is a charge gap generated by the AFM order,
and the localised soft mode could be of the multipolar type predicted by Thalmeier et al. [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref71">68</xref>
            ] or a
crystal-field excitation. As the model by Akbari et al. was constructed to explain the early INS
results by Friemel et al. [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref77">74</xref>
            ], the Q-dependence of Jq used in this model generates an exciton
only at the R-point. However, the more complete mapping in the study by Jang et al. has shown
that the spin dynamics across the Brillouin zone is more complicated than this, and the more
recent in-field measurements on Ce1 x Lax B6 have illustrated the possibility of a crossover between
itinerant and localised regimes. Whether this model can be adapted to explain these new results
remains to be seen.

          <title>3. Doped compound – Ce1 x Lax B6</title>
          <p>
            A significant body of research has been dedicated to investigating the effect of substituting
cerium with non-magnetic lanthanum in CeB6, as the absence of an f electron makes it an ideal
tuning parameter to investigate the heavy-fermion physics in this system. The outer orbital
structure of lanthanum is [Xe]5d16s2, similar to cerium but lacking any occupation of the 4 f 1
states. In the same manner as with cerium, the 6s2 electrons are donated to the boron octahedra,
and with the 5d1 electrons acting as itinerant conduction electrons we find that the substitution of
cerium with lanthanum dilutes the spins, resulting in the suppression of TN and TQ. We can see in
Fig. 1 (c) that these do not fall at the same rate, and TQ falls faster than TN until they coincide
at x 0.2 [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref129">126</xref>
            ]. Here, a new phase termed “phase IV” forms above TN, which then persists as
the ground state after the AFM phase is suppressed above the critical La concentration of x 0.3.
The magnetic phase diagram, illustrated in Fig. 1 (b), shows that above the critical concentration
phase II is now only accessible in finite field [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37 ref38">34, 35</xref>
            ]. Further doping towards pure LaB6 eventually
suppresses the correlated electron physics, replacing phase IV with the paramagnetic phase I as
the ground state of the system at around x = 0.7.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whilst the introduction of lanthanum adds chemical disorder into the system, it was noted by
Goodrich et al. that its scattering potential appears negligible, as evidenced by the observation of
dHvA oscillations within a range of lanthanum doped samples [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref85">82</xref>
            ]. They found that both the Fermi
surface topology and the quasiparticle effective masses transform gradually as a function of the
doping parameter x, in contrast to the rapid dephasing of quasiparticles at low concentrations of the
dopant atoms in previously studied dilute Kondo alloys [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref130 ref131">127, 128</xref>
            ]. Furthermore, recent neutron
scattering measurements on a variety of lanthanum doped samples find a common behaviour
for the excitation spectrum of all measured samples, with a smooth evolution of characteristic
parameters as a function of doping [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">15</xref>
            ]. These observations indicate that experimental results
from Ce1 x Lax B6 should reflect intrinsic effects, rather than being dominated by chemical disorder,
making this a model system for the study of diluting f -electron systems.
3.1. An update to the known phase diagrams
          </p>
          <p>
            Figure 1 (b) shows the magnetic field vs. lanthanum concentration x phase diagram for
Ce1 x Lax B6, for magnetic fields applied along the h110i and h100i directions, extrapolated to
zero temperature. A qualitatively identical phase diagram is found for magnetic field applied
along the h111i direction although the exact locations of the phase transitions will vary. The
lines indicating the phase boundaries are a guide for the eyes, and neither the QCP of the AFM
phase (phase III) nor the location of the quantum tri-critical point between phases II, III and IV
is well known. It is evident that this tri-critical point will change its location depending on the
direction of applied field, and that at higher doping levels, above x 0.7, phase IV gives way to the
paramagnetic state, although this region of the phase diagram is not well studied. In Fig. 12 (a) we
have significantly updated this phase diagram for fields applied along the (110) direction, collating
data from references [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref132 ref18 ref19 ref22 ref23 ref24">15, 16, 19–21, 129</xref>
            ]. In this figure, we can see that the exact location of the
AFM QCP is somewhere between x = 0.25 and x = 0.3, and that the tri-critical point between
phases II, III and IV appears to be very close to x = 0.5. There is a slight difference between the
behaviour of different samples from different studies, although this is perhaps expected given that

          <p>
            Figure 12 (b) is an updated version of the temperature vs. lanthanum concentration phase
diagram for Ce1 x Lax B6 at zero field originally seen in Fig. 1 (c). It is compiled predominantly
from specific heat, magnetisation and transport measurements [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref129 ref132 ref17 ref19 ref24 ref38">14, 16, 21, 35, 126, 129</xref>
            ] as well
as some recent neutron scattering data [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref112 ref133">109, 130</xref>
            ]. There are some significant changes to our
previous understanding of the phase diagram. It is now clear that the continuity in the phase II-I
and phase III-IV transition lines and the phase II-III and I-IV transition lines seen in Fig. 1 (c) is
incorrect, and that this was purely coincidental in the earlier study. The updated phase diagram
also strongly suggests that the QCP of the AFM phase is at x = 0.28, and whilst there are no
measurements near the termination of phase IV at high lanthanum concentrations, we can see
from the linear extrapolation of the phase IV transition temperature, TIV, that it probably ends
around x = 0.75, where quantum critical behaviour in the resistivity has been reported [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref134">131</xref>
            ]. It
also appears that phases II and IV do not terminate in connection to the phase III line at x = 0.2
but in fact meet just above the AFM phase boundary, which itself forms a smooth dome. This
would mean that the transition between the AFM and paramagnetic phases is avoided, although
this is inferred by following the transition lines and there potentially could still be a doping level
where all of the phases meet.
3.2. The order parameter of phase IV in Ce1 x Lax B6
          </p>
          <p>
            In a similar manner to the order parameter of phase II, the mechanism behind phase IV
has been difficult to determine. Experimental consensus remained elusive, with a variety of
propositions as to the nature of phase IV stemming from seemingly incompatible results. On
one hand, studies of the magnetic and transport properties [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37 ref38">34, 35</xref>
            ] have observed a continuous
transition line between TN and TIV, suggesting that phase IV, like phase III, is a magnetically ordered
state. The sharp peak in the heat capacity suggests a long-range ordered phase, whilst the cusp
in magnetic susceptibility across the transition in Fig. 13 (a) suggests a quench in the magnetic
degrees of freedom, which would imply that this is magnetic in nature [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17 ref37">14, 34</xref>
            ]. However, no such
magnetic signal has been found from neutron diffraction, with both powder and single crystal
studies ruling out long range magnetic order and providing support to multipolar ordering as a
candidate [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref136 ref137">133, 134</xref>
            ]. Furthermore, SR results show only a random distribution of internal fields
of the order of 0.1 T, displaying no anomaly across the phase III – phase IV boundary, perhaps
suggesting that phase IV is a short-range-order region of the AFM phase [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref138">135</xref>
            ]. An anomalously
large softening of the C44 elastic constant has been observed when entering phase IV [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">35</xref>
            ], which
is connected to a minute contraction ( L=L 10 6) of the lattice along the h111i direction. This
is not seen in phases II or III, and it has been argued that it is incompatible with long range AFQ
order [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23 ref37">20,34</xref>
            ]. Evidence for multipolar ordering is provided by RXS experiments [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref135 ref139 ref140 ref36">33,132,136,137</xref>
            ],
and data from Ref. [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref135">132</xref>
            ], on a sample with doping parameter x = 0.3, are reproduced in Fig. 13 (b).
These experiments, which monitored the L2 edge of cerium, have observed dipolar and octupolar
symmetry for the E1 and E2 transitions respectively. Both show a sudden onset when entering
phase IV, with some dipolar signal remaining above TIV [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref135">132</xref>
            ]. Recent elastic neutron scattering
has revealed a weak Bragg peak forming below TIV at ( 12 21 12 ) [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref140">137</xref>
            ], which is suppressed with the
application of magnetic field. These data also revealed an increase in the Bragg intensity I (Q)
with jQj, and this was interpreted as lending further evidence for an octupolar order parameter of
phase IV.
          </p>
          <p>
            Multipolar order was suggested from a mean-field theory study [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref141">138</xref>
            ], which explained the
(111) lattice distortion as a result a ferroquadrupolar ordering induced by an antiferrooctupolar
(AFO) ordering, the latter playing the role of the order parameter of phase IV. This model was also
able to account for the cusp in magnetisation at TIV [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">34</xref>
            ] and the softening of the elastic constant
which were observed in experiment. From this, a ground state of 5u octupolar ordering was
proposed. This is somewhat consistent with the RXS data reproduced in Fig. 13 (b), which show a
strong onset of the E2 edge below TIV. However, these results also suggest the onset of dipolar
order, with the q-width of the octupolar peak suggesting long-range order whilst the comparatively
broader dipolar peak indicates a short-range order. The temperature dependencies of these peaks
are markedly different, and as a result the authors of the RXS study suggest a novel segregated
order parameter phase of long range AFO order alongside mesoscopic AFM order [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref135">132</xref>
            ], which
also accounts for some of the discrepancies in the earlier experimental data.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite the disparity in early experimental results, the emerging consensus is that 5u AFO
ordering is the ground state of phase IV. However, it is evident that this is not the only correlated
behaviour to be found in phase IV. More recent RXS experiments, coupled with mean-field theory
calculations, have shown the presence of field-induced quadrupolar moments within the AFO phase
IV [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">33</xref>
            ]. Both 3g and 5g quadrupolar moments are observed to be induced by field within the AFO
phase, however in contrast to the mean-field calculation the 5g quadrupoles are induced far more
strongly than the 3g quadrupoles. The authors conclude that a large fluctuation of the 5g order is
hidden behind the 5u octupolar order, and speculate that quantum fluctuations from the close
degeneracy of the AFM, AFQ and AFO orders play an important role in a region where mean-field
models are unable to explain their experimental observations. This makes Ce1 x Lax B6 one of only
a handful of compounds where octupolar ordering has been reported, alongside NpO2 [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref142 ref143">139, 140</xref>
            ],
SmRu4P12 [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref144 ref145">141, 142</xref>
            ] and URu2Si2 [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref146 ref147">143, 144</xref>
            ].
3.3. Non-Fermi-liquid regime and quantum criticality in Ce1 x Lax B6
          </p>
          <p>
            Following the evolution of TN with doping in Fig. 12, at xc 0.3 there is a QCP for the AFM
phase, and it is expected that critical fluctuations in this region may result in deviations from FL
behaviour. However, a transport study found the FL behaviour at low temperatures to persist up
to a doping of x = 0.35, beyond the critical doping [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref134">131</xref>
            ], as illustrated in Fig. 14 (a). In the FL
regime the resistivity follows the law = 0 + AT 2, which was observed in these measurements.
As can be further seen in Fig. 14 (b), the parameter A, which is proportional to the square of the
effective mass m , increases divergently on the approach to xc in zero field, and at xc it assumes
a large but finite value which remains unchanged up to x = 0.5. This indicates that whilst FL
behaviour is being adhered to in the region of the AFM QCP, the system is experiencing a dramatic
mass enhancement with increasing lanthanum doping. This could be explained in a 3D SDW
quantum critical picture, where only a fraction of the quasiparticles are scattered from the critical
fluctuations, which are confined to “hot spot” wavevectors [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref134 ref148 ref149">131, 145, 146</xref>
            ]. Quasiparticles from the
contrasting “cold” regions of the Fermi surface remain unaffected, and the averaged effective mass
remains finite, although these results may also suggest that the mass enhancement is a property of
phase IV rather than a phenomenon emerging from criticality. Further doping beyond xc brings
the system into a situation where the AFM phase is no longer the ground state and can only be
realised in an applied field, while the ground state is now phase IV.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the region 0.35 &lt; x &lt; 0.8, non-Fermi liquid (NFL) behaviour has been observed in the
lowtemperature resistivity of Ce1 x Lax B6, which follows the relation = 0 + AT D with D &lt; 2 [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref134">131</xref>
            ],
as seen in Fig. 14. There is a distinct region at low fields and high lanthanum concentrations
where D has decreased from the value of 2 predicted for Fermi liquids, reaching D = 1 at x 0.7.
However, within the NFL region of Ce1 x Lax B6 the specific heat in phase I does not show diverging
behaviour with decreasing temperature [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref150 ref151">147, 148</xref>
            ] as expected for some NFL models [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref152 ref153">149, 150</xref>
            ].
Here the heat capacity can be described as Cp / T , with = 1.6 for x = 0.4 [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref150">147</xref>
            ]. Whilst this
is a deviation from FL behaviour (which assumes = 1), it could not be explained yet in any
known quantum-critical scenario, where an increase of specific heat with decreasing temperature
is typically expected [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref149">146</xref>
            ]. Furthermore, the magnetic susceptibility shows non-typical behaviour
within the NFL regime with signs of short-range AFM correlations surviving to low concentrations
of cerium, despite the NFL transport properties, and high lanthanum concentrations show local-FL
behaviour [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref134">131</xref>
            ].
          </p>
          <p>
            Whilst the coefficient D has decreased from 2 at concentrations below x = 0.35 to 1 at x = 0.7
across the NFL region as the lanthanum concentration increases, further increasing the lanthanum
concentration beyond x 0.8 reverses this trend, and D increases to 1.8 at Ce0.1La0.9B6 in zero
field (not shown in Fig. 14), with the value for A becoming negative at this point [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref134">131</xref>
            ]. It is
also important to note that within the doping-field phase diagram, the effective mass undergoes
an enhancement from the paramagnetic phase I on the approach to any of the ordered phases.
This effect, when measured as a function of applied magnetic field, appears to scale with the
concentration of cerium ions, and it is speculated that it therefore originates from a single-site
effect, such as the Kondo effect [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref134">131</xref>
            ]. The transition from FL to NFL behaviour may normally be
associated with the QCP, however in this system the same transition takes place away from the
QCP, and the NFL region extends over a wide range of doping, suggesting that the two are not
necessarily associated.
          </p>
          <p>
            Potential signs of quantum criticality near the critical doping, xc, have also been observed in
neutron-scattering measurements [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">15</xref>
            ]. Here, the authors investigate the behaviour of magnetic
excitations in Ce1 x Lax B6 as a function of both magnetic field and lanthanum concentration.
Whilst the spin excitations within phase IV are quasielastic in no applied field, it is found that
the “AFQ1” mode at the R point, induced by magnetic field within the AFQ phase, is significantly
broader in energy near the critical doping than in the other samples with lower doping levels.
This increase in linewidth could indicate the onset of critical fluctuations, which arise from the
suppression of the exciton energy close to zero as one approaches the critical doping. In contrast
to other heavy-fermion systems with quantum-critical behaviour such as YbRh2Si2 [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref154">151</xref>
            ] and
Ce3Pd20Si6 [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref155">152</xref>
            ], no critical fluctuations are observed near Bc or BQ. Friemel et al. [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">15</xref>
            ] argue
that the absence of a field-induced QCP can be explained by considering the itinerant magnetic
moments to be ferromagnetically coupled [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">36</xref>
            ], leading to a stabilisation of the associated spin
dynamics by the application of magnetic field. The observation that the energy scale of the AFQ1
mode vanishes as TN is driven to zero leads the authors to conclude that the AFM QCP near
xc = 0.3 is coincident in doping with the zero-field extrapolated QCP of the AFQ phase.
          </p>
          <p>
            The evolution from the FL state of LaB6 to the FL state of CeB6, passing through the local-FL
and NFL states, is in contrast to the path taken for typical non-magnetic HF systems, such as
Ce1 x Lax Cu6. Here, the system follows the = 0 + AT 2 throughout the entire doping range,
going from the local-FL at the lanthanum end of the spectrum to the FL region at the cerium end
without passing through the NFL regime [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref156">153</xref>
            ]. The behaviour of the f -electrons in these systems is
considered to be quite different, being notably itinerant in the CeCu6 in contrast to more localised
in the CeB6 system. However, as has been discussed previously in this review, the localised picture
is not able to fully describe the behaviour of CeB6 either, with the two-fluid heavy electron picture
providing a more satisfactory description. Whilst one might expect the NFL behaviour to originate
from the quantum criticality associated with the disappearing AFM phase, its persistence only at
the lanthanum-rich side of the phase diagram would perhaps point to a separate origin, possibly
requiring proximity to phase IV.
3.4. Superconductivity in LaB6
          </p>
          <p>
            For the metallic hexaboride LaB6 superconductivity has been reported in several studies.
Initially found to have a transition temperature of Tc = 5.7 K [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">17</xref>
            ], this result has proven difficult
to reproduce. Another study reported the transition to take place at 0.1 K [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref157">154</xref>
            ], whilst resistivity
measurements on several samples found no superconducting transition down to a temperature of
5 mK [

            ]. The most commonly accepted value appears to be 0.45 K [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref159">156</xref>
            ]. Several explanations
have been suggested for this disparity of results and the low critical temperature. The resistivity
studies of Ref. [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref158">155</xref>
            ] surprisingly found a slight increase of resistivity at low temperatures in this
otherwise metallic compound, and suggested that Kondo scattering from magnetic impurity atoms
in their samples could be responsible, and thus also explained the lack of superconductivity in
their sample. It has also been suggested that interactions between the boron octahedra and the
conduction electrons result in a deformation of the phonon modes and thus a suppression of the
superconducting critical temperature [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref159 ref160">156, 157</xref>
            ]. To our knowledge, determination of the true
intrinsic value of Tc as well as its behaviour upon Ce doping still remains an open problem.
3.5. Magnetic ion doping
          </p>
          <p>
            Recently, Kondo et al. and Matsumura et al. have experimented with co-doping Ce1 x Lax B6
with either Pr or Nd [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref161">158–160</xref>
            ]. In their initial study, it appeared that in Ce0.7Ndy La0.3 y B6 the
phase IV transition temperature is rapidly suppressed with Nd doping, whilst phase III is on the
contrary stabilised. However, in their following study they found contrasting behaviour. These
experiments involved doping Ce1 x Lax B6 with either Pd or Nd, and they found that what appeared
to be the transition temperature TIV showed a notable increase when the sample is doped with 10%
Pr or Nd when the cerium concentration is less than 0.5. For cerium concentrations of 0.6 or higher,
however, they found no effect. These two experiments, therefore, appeared to be contradictory.
From their specific heat, magnetisation and resistivity measurements in this study, they rule out
the pressure effect of doping with these ions, as their relative size and the change in transition
temperature would lead to an opposite effect. Further, they are able to rule out the contribution of
either octupolar or quadrupolar moments from the dopant ions. This leads them to conclude that it
is likely the dipole moments in these dopant ions which cause the stabilisation of the ground state.
However, they also note that dipolar moments cannot couple to the 5u octupolar moment favoured
by the prevalent mean-field theories describing phase IV. In order to shed further light on this
problem, they performed neutron-scattering measurements on Ce0.5Pr0.1La0.4B6 and discovered
that rather than the AFO order, which is expected for phase IV, it instead exhibits AFM dipole
order. The AFO order associated with phase IV has an ordering vector q = ( 21 21 21 ). However, the
neutron diffraction measurements clearly showed a magnetic peak at q = ( 41 41 12 ), the q-vector for
AFM order, with no intensity at the expected position for the AFO order. This perhaps explains
the disparity between their earlier studies, and shows that the AFM dipole order is one of the
competing order parameters within lanthanum doped CeB6, and that it is close enough in energy
to be realised under a weak perturbation.
          </p>
          <p>Phase diagrams for these systems are reproduced here in Fig. 15. The AFM order seen here is
labelled as phase V by the authors, to distinguish it from phase III, and is seen only for cerium
concentrations of 0.6 or less. For the cerium concentration of 0.6, the authors find that phase V
is not the ground state of the system, but is developing above phase III (in temperature) as the
R concentration is increased. Their results show that for cerium concentrations of less than 0.6,
phase III, the double-q structure seen in the ground state of CeB6, is only present at intermediate
fields, with the ground state becoming phase IV, that is realised below 1.8 T. At higher fields the
development of phases III and II in a similar manner to CeB6 is found. Above 4 T the AFQ order
is realised, indicated by the presence of a magnetic Bragg peak with q = ( 21 21 21 ), induced by field
and modulated by the underlying AFQ order.</p>
          <p>It is worth noting here that the neutron diffraction measurements showed an unusual
temperature dependence of the scattered intensity, not characteristic of a typical developing
order parameter. The authors point out that this is concurrent with the characteristic shape of
the specific heat anomaly reported in their earlier measurements [159] and suggests that the
development of long-range order is hindered by by Pr-doping. The orbital structure of Pr possesses
a different ground state from cerium, and the differing magnetic interactions originating from
these two ions may be hindering the development of magnetic order, in a manner that may be
similar to that observed in Ce1 x Prx B6 [161].</p>

      <p>4.1. Cex Pr1 x B6</p>
      <p>
        Recently, the compound Cex Pr1 x B6 has attracted attention, in addition to the mentioned
experiments where Pr is co-doped into Ce1 x Lax B6. A variety of publications have investigated
the low-temperature magnetically ordered phases of this compound across the complete range of
doping levels [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref83">80, 161–163</xref>
        ]. The crystal-field ground state of the Pr3+ ions is a 3 triplet state, as
opposed to the 8 ground state of cerium in CeB6, and this triplet state can support quadrupolar
moments, but not the octupolar moments which play an active role in the physics of the cerium
based hexaborides. PrB6 exhibits no AFQ order in the manner of CeB6, but instead supports two
low-temperature AFM phases. Firstly it enters an incommensurate state passing below TN = 7 K,
and then undergoes a lock-in transition to commensurate antiferromagnetic order at TC = 4.2 K.
The commensurate phase (C-phase) is of the same double-k structure as CeB6, and it has been
argued that the similarity with CeB6 suggests an association with the Ox y type AFQ order that
plays a role in CeB6. However, as a counterpoint to this, GdB6 possesses an AFM phase with the
same ordering vectors as CeB6 and PrB6, but has no 4f orbital degeneracy, and so it has been
suggested instead that this particular AFM structure is a result of features of the Fermi surface that
are common to all light-earth hexaborides [164].
      </p>
      <p>The phase diagram of Cex Pr1 x B6 from the neutron scattering study of Mignot et al. is
reproduced in Fig. 16. They find that the system displays a variety of magnetic structures as a
function of doping and temperature, with the PrB6-like region of the phase diagram extending to
remarkably high cerium concentrations of around x = 0.8. The commensurate magnetic order
characteristic of the ground state of PrB6 is directly observed in their measurements only until
x = 0.1, whilst two incommensurate magnetic states also characteristic of PrB6-like behaviour are
seen all the way up to x = 0.8. This is a crossover situation, as both PrB6 and CeB6 behaviour
exists at this doping. Indeed, data from Ref. [162] at x = 0.7, whilst showing a Pr-like ground
state, also exhibits the Ce-like phase II under applied field. At the highest cerium concentrations,
phases II and III are observed, and it appears that light doping by Pr ions actually stabilises phase
III at the expense of phase II.</p>
      <p>Whilst the commensurate phase is only indicated for the lowest Ce concentrations, it is
important to note that these results are based on both single-crystal and powder diffraction, which
show slightly different behaviour. For the x = 0.2 and 0.4 concentrations, reflections associated
with the C-phase were present alongside the incommensurate order all the way up to TN in the
powder data, whilst the single-crystal data showed no C-phase at these concentrations. This
behaviour is also seen in the pure compound, with commensurate reflections are seen immediately
below TN alongside the incommensurate peaks, and no distinct lock-in to a commensurate phase
is observed. The origin of this behaviour is not yet known. The IC2 phase seen in these data
is not observed in pure PrB6 in zero field, but is related to a distinct type of incommensurate
magnetic order which is seen in applied magnetic field, and has also been observed in La-doped
PrB6. This series is an illustration of the importance of octupolar interactions in CeB6 in stabilising
the AFQ phase, as the Ox y quadrupolar interactions are known to play a role across this entire</p>

4.2. Ce3Pd20Si6</p>
      <p>Ce3Pd20Si6 is a relatively new clathrate compound (R3Pd20X6, R = rare earth, X = Si, Ge)
which has attracted recent attention due to indications of multipolar ordering in its low-temperature
phases. It consists of two inter-penetrating sub-lattices of cerium, as shown in Fig. 17 (a). The
structure possesses one simple-cubic and one face-centred-cubic (fcc) lattice, with each cerium
ion surrounded by a cage of either palladium or silicon-palladium depending on which
sublattice the Ce ion belongs to. Whilst one might expect that the significantly different crystal
structures of CeB6 and Ce3Pd20Si6 would lead to different low temperature behaviour for the two
compounds, inspection of the temperature-field phase diagram shown in Fig. 17 (b) indicates that
Ce3Pd20Si6 may be remarkably similar in behaviour to CeB6, potentially displaying the same
lowtemperature phases albeit at greatly reduced temperatures and fields. It is clear that Ce3Pd20Si6,
alongside Ce3Pd20Gd6 [165], differs from many of its relatives in the isostructural R3Pd20X6 group
in that it doesn’t exhibit a pair of antiferromagnetic transitions. These have been seen, one
for each sub-lattice, in its relatives Tb3Pd20Si6 [166], Dy3Pd20Si6 [167], Nd3Pd20Ge6 [168] and
Nd3Pd20Si6 [169]. It does however exhibit two low-temperature ordered phases, II and III, with
the characteristic enhancement with field of the AFQ phase in CeB6 also seen in the phase II of
this material, which in turn surrounds a similarly placed ground-state phase III. Magnetisation
measurements have indicated that phase III in this material may be either an AFM or ordered
octupolar phase [170], with neutron scattering showing the presence of static AFM order [171,172].
Magnetic susceptibility [173] and ultrasound [174, 175] measurements have strongly suggested
that phase II in this material is an AFQ phase. This situation looks remarkably similar to CeB6, and</p>

should phase II in this material be the same as it is in CeB6, residing on the simple-cubic cerium
sublattice, then we would expect an AFQ phase with a propagation vector of (111).</p>
      <p>Perhaps one of the most significant complications when investigating Ce3Pd20Si6 with
diffraction experiments arises from its crystal structure. Whilst recent neutron measurements
have indicated that the fcc sublattice of cerium is “magnetically silent” [176], it still provides
complications for investigating the nature of the low-temperature phases. Although recent
macroscopic measurements have suggested that phase II of Ce3Pd20Si6 is an AFQ phase as in CeB6,
should the ordering vector of this phase be also be at ( 12 12 12 ) for the simple-cubic lattice, as in
CeB6, then under neutron scattering it would fall on the (111) nuclear Bragg peak arising from
the fcc sublattice. The tactic that was successful in CeB6, of observing an AFM order induced by
applied magnetic field but modulated to the AFQ order, would in this case be more complicated,
since the disparate strength of the nuclear and magnetic signals would render the latter difficult
to distinguish. Recent measurements are consistent with the cerium ions in the 8c simple-cubic
sublattice [Ce2 in Fig. 17 (a)] having a 8 ground state with a 7 excited state some 3.9 meV above
this [176,177], whilst the 4a fcc lattice cerium ions seem to possess a 7 ground state [174,178,179].
Interestingly enough, when taking into account the lack of contribution of the fcc lattice, the
magnetic environment of Ce3Pd20Si6 echoes that of CeB6 [176, 179], and Goto et al. have noted
that with the inter-site distance of the simple cubic lattice being larger in Ce3Pd20Si6 than for CeB6,
one might expect the inter-site coupling to be correspondingly weaker, which may account for the
reduced temperature scales in this material.</p>

      <title>5. Summary</title>
      <p>Despite more than 50 years of research on CeB6 and its doped analogues, such as Ce1 x Lax B6, it
continues to display interesting and unexplained physics, with more modern techniques unearthing
behaviour not predicted by theories which were able to describe earlier results. The variety of
lowtemperature ordering phenomena it displays, resulting from a complex interplay of both competing
and cooperating interactions, has proven difficult to model and, with a complete understanding
remaining an elusive goal, demands further investigation from both theory and experiment. It is
evident that the interesting low-temperature physics of this system predominantly arises from the
8 crystal-field ground state of the Ce3+ ion. This supports a variety of multipolar moments that
are able to interact and order, with some acting as competing order parameters whilst others seem
to cooperate to undergo ordering. Being metallic, the system also displays a variety of interesting
heavy-fermion phenomena, and it is clear that the f -electrons are not always a purely localised
entity, so that in order to explain the behaviour of this system it is necessary to account for their
two-faced nature. Furthermore, recent results from a variety of experiments have unearthed a
host of novel phenomena, ranging from the presence of a SDW to the system’s proximity to a
ferromagnetic instability. These unexplained results, the continued characterisation of phase IV
and the new and interesting physics arising from the doping of CeB6 with other magnetic ions
indicate that this model system will remain an interesting and active research topic for many years
to come.</p>
