0,"A gravitationally collapsed object can bounce-out from its horizon via a tunnelling process that violates the classical equations in a nite region. Since tunnelling is a non-perturbative phenomenon, it cannot be described in terms of quantum uctuations around a classical solution and a backgroundfree formulation of quantum gravity is needed to analyze it. Here we use Loop Quantum Gravity to compute the amplitude for this process, in a rst approximation. The amplitude determines the tunnelling time as a function of the mass. This is the key information to evaluate the relevance of this process for the interpretation of Fast Radio Bursts or high-energy cosmic rays. The calculation o ers a template and a concrete example of how a background-free quantum theory of gravity can be used to compute a realistical observable quantity.",Marios Christodoulou Carlo Rovelli Simone Speziale Ilya Vilensky,Planck-Star Tunnelling-Time: an Astrophysically Relevant Observable from Background-Free Quantum Gravity,"A gravitationally collapsed object can bounce-out from its horizon via a tunnelling process that violates the classical equations in a ﬁnite region.
